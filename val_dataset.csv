"Elizabeth Eliza had heard at Philadelphia how much women had done, and she felt they ought to contribute to such a cause. She had an idea, but she would not speak of it at first, not until after she had written to the lady from Philadelphia. She had often thought, in many cases, if they had asked her advice first, they might have saved trouble.
Still, how could they ask advice before they themselves knew what they wanted? It was very easy to ask advice, but you must first know what to ask about. And again: Elizabeth Eliza felt you might have ideas, but you could not always put them together. There was this idea of the water-trough, and then this idea of getting some money for it. So she began with writing to the lady from Philadelphia. The little boys believed she spent enough for it in postage-stamps before it all came out.
But it did come out at last that the Peterkins were to have some charades at their own house for the benefit of the needed water-trough, tickets sold only to especial friends.",1
"The U.S.S. Plymouth was Jack Templeton's first command. He had been elevated to the rank of captain only a few weeks before. Naturally he was not a little proud of his vessel. When Jack was given his ship, it was only natural, too, that Frank Chadwick, who had been his associate and chum through all the days of the great war, should become Jack's first officer.
In spite of the fact that Jack's rating as captain was in the British navy, he was at this moment in command of an American vessel. This came about through a queer combination of circumstances.
The American commander of the Plymouth had been taken suddenly ill. At almost the same time the Plymouth had been ordered to proceed from Dover to Liverpool to join other American vessels. Almost on the eve of departure, the first officer also was taken ill. It was to him the command naturally would have fallen in the captain's absence. The second officer was on leave of absence. Thus, without a skipper, the Plymouth could not have sailed.",1
"The Soviet Union (short for Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or USSR) was a single-party Marxist-Leninist state. It existed from 1922 until 1991, and was the first country to declare itself socialist and build towards a communist society. It was a union of fourteen Soviet Socialist Republics and one Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (Russia).
The Soviet Union was created after Vladimir Lenin led the overthrow of Alexander Kerensky. The communist government developed industry and over time became a major, powerful union. The largest country in the Union was Russia, and Kazakhstan was the second. The capital city of the Soviet Union was Moscow. Although technically countries could become independent if they wanted, in practice it was a completely centralized government, with no states' rights for the member countries. Many believe that the Soviet Union was the final stage of the Russian Empire; since the USSR covered most of the land of the former Empire.",1
"The king dwelt for many months in Nottingham, but no man came to claim the knight's lands, nor could he ever hear of Robin Hood in what part of the country he might be. But always Robin went freely here and there, roving wherever he chose over hill and valley, slaying the king's deer, and disposing of it at his will.
Then a head forester, who was in close attendance on the king, spoke up, and said:
""If you would see good Robin you must do as I tell you. Take five of the best knights that are in your train, and go down to yonder abbey, and get you monks' habits. I will be your guide to show you the way, and before you get back to Nottingham I dare wager my head that you will meet with Robin if he be still alive. Before you come to Nottingham you shall see him with your own eyes.""
The king hastened to follow the forester's counsel; he and his five monks went to the abbey, and speedily disguised themselves in the garb of monks, and then blithely returned home through the greenwood.",1
"Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and Jorindel said, Û÷We must take care that we don't go too near to the fairy's castle.' It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall birches.
Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves at a loss to know what path to take.",1
"The Zimmermann Telegram (also called the Zimmermann Note) was a telegram sent to Mexico from Germany on January 16, 1917. It was what made America enter World War I. It is named for the German man who sent it, Arthur Zimmermann. Zimmerman was the German Foreign Secretary (took care of things with other countries). Zimmermann sent it to the German ambassador in the United States, Johann von Bernstorff. Bernstorff then sent it to the German ambassador in Mexico, Heinrich von Eckardt. The telegram told the ambassador to ask the Mexicans to join the war on the German side by attacking America. Germany promised to help Mexico take back land the United States had taken from Mexico in the MexicanÛÒAmerican War. These places were Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Germany wanted Mexico to enter the war so America would be too busy to help the enemies of Germany. Mexico was already busy with the Mexican Revolution and did not like the idea.",1
"Viscosity is a physical property of fluids. It shows resistance to flow. In a simple example, water has a low viscosity, as it is 'thin'. Syrup or tar, on the other hand has a high viscosity, as it is 'thick'. A way to test for viscosity is the speed at which the substance runs down a slope. Syrup would reach the bottom very slowly, whereas water would be a lot quicker.
There are two types of viscosity: dynamic viscosity, measured in pascal seconds, and kinematic viscosity, measured in meters per second squared.
Viscosity is used as a way to predict when volcanoes erupt. When the lava comes out very thickly (viscous), there is more chance that it will erupt violently. This is because the lava has a hard time getting out and may burst out when it can. If the lava is thin (low viscosity), then it just flows out like water.
The word viscous comes from the Latin viscum, meaning sticky.",1
"When the two friends had thus become reconciled, they examined the cub, and saw that it had a slight wound in its foot, and could not walk; and while they were thinking what they should do, they spied out the herb called ""Doctor's NakasÌ©,"" which was just sprouting; so they rolled up a little of it in their fingers and applied it to the part. Then they pulled out some boiled rice from their luncheon-box and offered it to the cub, but it showed no sign of wanting to eat; so they stroked it gently on the back and petted it; and as the pain of the wound seemed to have subsided, they were admiring the properties of the herb, when, opposite to them, they saw the old foxes sitting watching them by the side of some stacks of rice straw.",1
"One simple example would be setting up an experiment to see if a particular plant food improved plant growth over a month. First, we would get 20 of the same type of plants of a similar age and size. In this example, plant type, age, and size at the start of the experiment are variables that we want to keep the same. Next, we would divide the plants into two groups by numbering them and randomly drawing numbers. The first 10 plants would go into our treatment groupÛÓthe plants that get the plant food. The second 10 plants will go into what we call our control groupÛÓthese are the plants that do not get plant food. This method of assigning things to groups is called randomization, and it makes sure that every plant involved in our study has an equal chance of being picked for either group. This is the best way to make sure that the groups are as equal as possible. Then, for a month, we give the plant food to the treatment group but not to the control group. All the other variables are kept exactly the sameÛÓthe plants get the same amount of sunlight, the same environment, and the same water.",1
"Much to his surprise, the youth found that he was not called on to join his comrades in misfortune, but was left behind in solitude. While casting about in his mind as to what this could mean, he observed in a corner the two rolls of black bread which he had received the previous night, and which, not being hungry at the time, he had neglected. As a healthy appetite was by that time obtruding itself on his attention, he took hold of one and began to eat. It was not attractive, but, not being particular, he consumed it. He even took up the other and ate that also, after which he sighed and wished for more! As there was no more to be had, he went to the fountain in the court and washed his breakfast down with water.",1
"In the course of the next three generations, the political and social elements of Roman civilization in Britain seem to have disappeared. A few words, such as ""port"" and ""street,"" which may or may not have been derived from the Latin, have come down to us. But there was nothing left, of which we can speak with absolute certainty, save the material shell, the walls, roads, forts, villas, arches, gateways, altars, and tombs, whose ruins are still seen scattered throughout the land.
The soil, also, is full of relics of the same kind. Twenty feet below the surface of the London of today lie the remains of the London of the Romans. In digging in the ""City,"" the laborer's shovel every now and then brings to light pieces of carved stone with Latin inscriptions, bits of rusted armor, broken swords, fragments of statuary, and gold and silver ornaments.",1
"Coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals. Coral reefs are built by colonies of tiny animals found in marine waters that contain few nutrients. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, which in turn consist of polyps that cluster in groups. The polyps belong to a group of animals known as Cnidaria, which also includes sea anemones and jellyfish. Unlike sea anemones, corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons which support and protect the coral polyps. Most reefs grow best in warm, shallow, clear, sunny and agitated waters.
Often called ""rainforests of the sea"", shallow coral reefs form some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They occupy less than 0.1% of the world's ocean surface, about half the area of France, yet they provide a home for at least 25% of all marine species, including fish, mollusks, worms, crustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, tunicates and other cnidarians. Paradoxically, coral reefs flourish even though they are surrounded by ocean waters that provide few nutrients.",1
"  This paper proposes several tests of restricted specification innonparametric instrumental regression. Based on series estimators, teststatistics are established that allow for tests of the general model against aparametric or nonparametric specification as well as a test of exogeneity ofthe vector of regressors. The tests' asymptotic distributions under correctspecification are derived and their consistency against any alternative modelis shown. Under a sequence of local alternative hypotheses, the asymptoticdistributions of the tests is derived. Moreover, uniform consistency isestablished over a class of alternatives whose distance to the null hypothesisshrinks appropriately as the sample size increases. A Monte Carlo studyexamines finite sample performance of the test statistics.",2
"On February 1, 1960, the peaceful activists introduced a new tactic into their set of strategies. Four African American college students walked up to a whites-only lunch counter at the local Woolworth's store in Greensboro, North Carolina, and asked for coffee. When service was refused, the students sat patiently. Despite threats and intimidation, the students sat quietly and waited to be served.
The civil rights sit-in was born.
No one participated in a sit-in of this sort without seriousness of purpose. The instructions were simple: sit quietly and wait to be served. Often the participants would be jeered and threatened by local customers. Sometimes they would be pelted with food or ketchup. Protestors did not respond when provoked by angry onlookers. In the event of a physical attack, the student would curl up into a ball on the floor and take the punishment. Any violent reprisal would undermine the spirit of the sit-in. When the local police came to arrest the demonstrators, another line of students would take the vacated seats.
Sit-in organizers believed that if the violence were only on the part of the white community, the world would see the righteousness of their cause.",0
"  Craig interpolation is a widespread method in verification, with importantapplications such as Predicate Abstraction, CounterExample Guided AbstractionRefinement and Lazy Abstraction With Interpolants. Most state-of-the-art modelchecking techniques based on interpolation require collections of interpolantsto satisfy particular properties, to which we refer as ""collectives""; they donot hold in general for all interpolation systems and have to be establishedfor each particular system and verification environment. Nevertheless, nosystematic approach exists that correlates the individual interpolation systemsand compares the necessary collectives. This paper proposes a uniformframework, which encompasses (and generalizes) the most common collectivesexploited in verification. We use it for a systematic study of the collectivesand of the constraints they pose on propositional interpolation systems used inSAT-based model checking.",2
"The Central Powers were a group of nations fighting against the Allied Powers during World War I; the members included Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria and their territories. They were also supported by Azerbaijan and Finland, as well as Lithuania in 1918 and co-belligerent Jabal Shammar. They lost the war. The Allied Forces include Great Britain, Canada, Newfoundland, Russia, France, later the United States, Greece, Portugal, Brazil, Georgia, Armenia, Australia and even Japan
Italy joined the allies in the midst of World War I, though all they wanted was to get some colonies. This greed lasted till World War II, but Italy did not gain anything they wanted to. In the middle of the war Germany gave up on them and took over Greece, so Italy joined the Alies, falling against their alliance with Germany once more They also wanted to destroy the Allies with tanks which were left on the beaches of Normandy on D-Day.",1

"Kit Midge was thought in the family to be a wonderful little cat. She enjoyed sitting in the sunshine; she liked to feast upon the dainty little mice; and, oh, dear me! now and then, she liked to catch a bird!
This was very naughty, of course; but the best trained cats have their faults. One morning Kit ate her breakfast with great relish, washed her face and paws, smoothed down her fur coat, and went into the parlor to take a nap in the big arm-chair.
The sun shone full in her face; and she blinked and purred and felt very good-natured; for, only the night before, she had caught her first rat, and for such a valiant deed had been praised and petted to her heart's content.
Well, Kit Midge fell asleep in the chair, with one little pink ear turned back, that she might wake easily, and a black tail curled round her paws.",0
"Edith was four years old, and had come the day before, for the first time in her life, to stay on a large farm. She had never seen young chickens, except in picture-books: so you can imagine how pleased she was at the thought of seeing real live ones.
She was soon in the farmyard, and after feeding the little things with meal and water,ÛÓhasty-pudding she called it,ÛÓshe seemed to long so to pet them, that her kind grandmother said, ""Well, dear, hold up your apron, and I will put some of the chickens in; but you must handle them very gently.""

But, when she saw Edith walking off with some of her darlings, she began to spread her wings, and puff out her feathers, and scold in hen fashion.",0
"  The aim of this work is to address the description of hyperinflation regimesin economy. The spirals of hyperinflation developed in Brazil, Israel, andNicaragua are revisited. This new analysis of data indicates that the episodesoccurred in Brazil and Nicaragua can be understood within the frame of themodel available in the literature, which is based on a nonlinear feedback (NLF)characterized by an exponent $\beta>0$. In the NLF model the accumulatedconsumer price index carries a finite time singularity of the type$1/(t_c-t)^{(1- \beta)/\beta}$ determining a critical time $t_c$ at which theeconomy would crash. It is shown that in the case of Brazil the entire episodecannot be described with a unique set of parameters because the time series wasstrongly affected by a change of policy. This fact gives support to the ""socalled"" Lucas critique, who stated that model's parameters usually change oncepolicy changes. On the other hand, such a model is not able to provide any$t_c$ in the case of the weaker hyperinflation occurred in Israel. It is shownthat in this case the fit of data yields $\beta \to 0$. This limit leads to thelinear feedback formulation which does not predict any $t_c$. An extension forthe NLF model is suggested.",2

"In a city not far from Boston, there once lived a stout little fellow named Willie Wilkins. He was six years old, had red cheeks and blue eyes, and such curly hair that it was always in a tumble, no matter how much it was brushed.
One summer his mamma took him into the country to spend a few weeks at a farm-house. The farmer's wife, Mrs. Hill, was very glad to have him come, for she had no girls or boys of her own, to make the house pleasant. She liked to see Willie running about, and hear his shrill voice calling after the great house-dog Bruno.
One morning Willie had been as busy as ever at his play: he had been in the orchard, hunting for ripe apples; he had been in the barn, looking for hen's eggs in the sweet hay; he had been down to the brook, sailing his boat; and he had played market-man, with Bruno harnessed for a horse.",0
"The sound is funneled through the outside of the ear, which is called the pinna, into the ear canal. These two parts are called the outer ear. The sound then vibrates the ear drum, which in turn sets the ossicles (a set of three tiny bones in the middle ear) in motion. This motion of the ossicles creates waves in the fluid of the snail-shaped cochlea. The cochlea is located deep inside, in an area called the inner ear. The cochlea is the place where the sound energy is converted into electrical impulses by thousands of tiny hair cells. The auditory nerve passes this information to the brain, where the details of the sound such as its characteristics, pitch, loudness, and direction, are then understood, so that the boy recognizes the sound of the engine as a car approaching from behind him. This is a rapid process that happens in less than a second. The speed of the hearing process allows the boy to quickly react.
Our hearing system, especially the hair cells in the inner ear, is very sensitive and can easily be damaged by loud sounds. Once these hair cells are damaged, the damage is permanent.",1
"At last the donkey grew so old that he was no longer of any use for work, and his master wished to get rid of him.

There on the grass was a fine large sheep. This sheep had a fleece of gold and his horns were gold, too. The children wanted to pat the sheep, but they could not catch him. When they went near, he ran away on the clouds.
Every day they played in the garden and every day the sheep came, too. By and by he grew tame and let the children pat his golden fleece.

"  Lock-in, the escalating commitment of decision-makers to an ineffectivecourse of action, has the potential to explain the large cost overruns in largescale transportation infrastructure projects. Lock-in can occur both at thedecision-making level (before the decision to build) and at the project level(after the decision to build) and can influence the extent of overruns in twoways. The first involves the methodology of calculating cost overruns accordingto the formal decision to build. Due to lock-in, however, the real decision tobuild is made much earlier in the decision-making process and the costsestimated at that stage are often much lower than those that are estimated at alater stage in the decision-making process, thus increasing cost overruns. Thesecond way that lock-in can affect cost overruns is through practice. Althoughdecisions about the project (design and implementation) need to be made,lock-in can lead to inefficient decisions that involve higher costs. Sunk costs(in terms of both time and money), the need for justification, escalatingcommitment, and inflexibility and the closure of alternatives are indicators oflock-in. In this paper, two case studies, of the Betuweroute and the HSL-Southprojects in the Netherlands, demonstrate the presence of lock-in and itsinfluence on the extent of cost overruns at both the decision-making andproject levels. This suggests that recognition of lock-in as an explanation forcost overruns significantly contributes to the understanding of the inadequateplanning process of projects and allows development of more appropriate means.",2

"There stood the table against the kitchen wall, with a little gray mouse on it nibbling a crumb of cheese. A long finger of sunlight streamed through the western window and touched the great stone stove, as if trying to waken the fire within. A beam fell upon a pan of water standing on the floor and sent gay sparkles of light dancing over the shining tins in the cupboard. The cuckoo saw it all at a glance. ""This will never do,"" he ticked indignantly. There was a queer rumbling sound in his insides as if his feelings were getting quite too much for him, and then suddenly he sent a loud ""cuckoo"" ringing through the silent room. Instantly the little gray mouse leaped down from the table and scampered away to his hole in the wall, the golden sunbeam flickered and was gone, and shadows began to creep into the corners.

"  Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids (PAs) are a group of naturally occurring alkaloidsthat are produced by plants as a defense mechanism against insect herbivores.The analytical methodologies employed for their detection have come a long waysince the first analytical experiment and in the last 30 years had an enormousdevelopment, both technological and experimental. It is notorious that beforethe generalization of certain technologies, especially in a post-waratmosphere, most scientific researches relied on what it is today thin-layerchromatography. Nevertheless this technique was not sufficient for accuratelymeasure quantities and unambiguously identify compounds, thereforespectroscopic techniques arose as well as chromatographic techniques. While thefirst never really coped with PAs analysis requirements the latter, either asgas or liquid chromatography allowed the analysis of complex sample matrices.Simultaneously, nuclear magnetic resonance also suffered significantdevelopments while mass spectrometry has become an attractive technique due toincreasingly higher maximum resolutions. The observed tendency in recent years,in pyrrolizidine detection and quantification, as well as in many other areas,is that hyphenated techniques are the chosen methods. A large number of papersreport multihyphenated methodologies, and the overwhelming majority relies ongas or liquid chromatography.",2
"Could you imagine eating the same food for your whole life? How boring! Now imagine if that one food were poisonous? Yuck! Koalas do exactly that; they eat the leaves of a tree called Eucalyptus every day. Eucalyptus trees have poisons in their leaves that prevent most animals from eating them, but not koalas! Now that is a cool characteristic of a superhero! But how can they survive on nothing but poisonous leaves? Well, it turns out there are special microbes in the tummies of koalas that work really hard to break down the poisonous parts of the leaves into smaller pieces that cannot hurt the koala. Most of the microbes in the koala's tummy are just hanging out, a good example of commensalism. This means that these microbes are not helping break down the poisons, but they are not hurting the koalas either. One microbe that can break down the leaves, Lonepinella koalarum, is an important poison-fighting sidekick and forms a mutualism with koalas. Scientists are still learning about these microbes that serve as sidekicks to their koala superheroes.",0
"Why do humans feel the need to be creative and enjoy creative material? While creativity is a basic part of human thinking, what counts as creativity and how do we measure it? Creativity is often viewed as a subjective field, meaning that everyone's personal opinion about creativity is different, so we need to have a really clear definition in order to understand what creativity is. So, what exactly is creativity? While there are many components of creativity, including originality, pleasure, value, process, and imagination, the definition that scientists use to study creativity puts those components together to say that creativity is an ability to produce something that is both novel (or original) and has utility (is valuable to someone). This definition allows scientists to develop of testable hypotheses about how creativity arises from the human brain.
We all interact with, process, and produce creativity differently, which makes creating a universal definition of creativity very challenging. As Steve Jobs reminds us, even creative people have a hard time seeing the things they think and create as creative!",1

"A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets. A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic field. An everyday example is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door. Materials that can be magnetized, which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet, are called ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic). These include iron, nickel, cobalt, some alloys of rare earth metals, and some naturally occurring minerals such as lodestone. Although ferromagnetic (and ferrimagnetic) materials are the only ones attracted to a magnet strongly enough to be commonly considered magnetic, all other substances respond weakly to a magnetic field, by one of several other types of magnetism.",1
"On the morning of the first day of school, Dorothea was suddenly awakened by a loud ting-a-ling-a-ling. She sat up in bed and rubbed her eyes. The room was flooded with morning light and the brass knobs on her bed gleamed cheerfully at her and seemed to say: ""Get up, get up!"" Now Dorothea was a ""sleepyhead"" and had seldom been known to get up when first awakened.

The ting-a-ling-a-ling sounded once more. ""It's in this room somewhere!"" she exclaimed, bouncing out of bed.

"""I don't believe it is anything of any account,"" cried brother John. ""She wants to keep us curious.""
""Well, I think Pansy must be learning a new piece to recite,"" said her mother.
""That's not it,"" said Pansy. ""It's a 'portant secret: one that my mother will like to hear.""
""Oh, it's important, is it?"" said papa. ""I do wonder what it can be.""
""Mother, what day was it that you lost your wedding-ring?"" said John.
""Don't speak of it, John. It was more than a month ago. I have hunted high and low, and cannot find it. I would have given all my other jewelry rather than have lost it.""
Here Pansy turned red in the face, got down from her high-chair, and ran out of the room.
""Did you see that?"" said papa. ""The little rogue has found the ring, and that's her 'portant secret.""
In a minute Pansy came back, holding up the ring, and her face radiant with delight. ""I found it, mother, among my doll's things. You must have dropped it there when you were fixing them.""
And so little Pansy's secret was out at last!",1

"If you snorkel or dive in the Red Sea, you will see large, colorful rocks surrounded by different types of fish. These amazing structures are actually not rocksÛÓthey are animals called corals and they build coral reefs. Yes, they are animals! These animals do not live alone, instead they live with tiny plant cells inside them and many other microbes, such as bacteria and viruses. Coral animals and their friends are in danger, because the water temperature is getting higher and because humans throw their trash into the oceans. Did you know that corals can be ill and have diseases, just like human beings? Many coral diseases have been described. One of these coral diseases is called black band disease (BBD). This article will explain what BBD is, what causes it, and how we can help corals to be healthier.",0

"Anthony, walking along Forty-second Street one afternoon under a steel-gray sky, ran unexpectedly into Richard Caramel emerging from the Manhattan Hotel barber shop. It was a cold day, the first definitely cold day, and Caramel had on one of those knee-length, sheep-lined coats long worn by the working men of the Middle West, that were just coming into fashionable approval. His soft hat was of a discreet dark brown, and from under it his clear eye flamed like a topaz.

"When they reached the first piece of fatty meat, Hyena felt a jerk. One of Raven's tail feathers came off in his hand! Then there was another jerk, and another. Raven felt much lighter, and the ache in his tail was going. He sang: Raven's feathers, unpluck yourselves. Raven's feathers, unpluck yourselves. In response, Hyena sang the opposite: Raven's feathers hold on, don't unpluck yourselves. Raven's feathers hold on, don't unpluck yourselves. 
 Finally, the feathers could not hold Hyena anymore. He was in the middle of nowhere in the sky. He jumped onto the fatty meat thinking that as he ate, the fatty meat would hold him. But as he tried to hold and eat the 'meat', all he felt was moist cloud! By now he was falling fast. ""Help, help!"" he shouted. But no one could hear him. Raven was lost in the clouds.

From that day to now, Hyena limps and he has many scars on his body. He has never been able to fly.",1
"A long, long way from here, there is a country called Norway. It is a very cold country, and very rocky; and there are a great many small islands all around it. It is on these islands that the dear little eider-ducks build their nests. They take a great deal of time and trouble to make them, and they use fine seaweed, mosses, and dry sticks, so as to make them as strong as they can.
When the mother-duck has laid four or five eggs, which are of a pretty, green color, she plucks out some of the soft gray down that grows on her breast, to cover them up, and keep them warm, while she goes off to find some food.
And now what do you think happens? Why, when she comes back to sit on her eggs, she finds that all her eggs and beautiful down have been taken away! Oh, how she cries, and flaps her wings, to find her darling eggs gone!",0
"Of all the specialized industries in the colonies, shipbuilding was the most important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak for timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rope made the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in the seventeenth century a ship was built at New Amsterdam, and by the middle of that century shipyards were scattered along the New England coast at Newburyport, Salem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London, and New Haven. Yards at Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York built ships for the trade of that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmington and Philadelphia soon entered the race and outdistanced New York, though unable to equal the pace set by New England. While Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina also built ships, Southern interest was mainly confined to the lucrative business of producing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and tar. ",1

The king addressed the people, ""My family and I are going away to the other part of Okugbe Island. We want to feel the pain that other people feel."" People whispered amongst themselves. The elders did not believe him. But who could question the king? So, everyone drank and feasted. The next day, the king and his family sailed away. For the first two days, the boats rolled through the waters. The sky was clear, the sea was calm, and the trip was a happy one. On the third day, the sea became rough. The sky became cloudy. A great storm came upon them. The boats were overturned. The king was helpless as his wealth and family were lost to the sea. The king alone survived.",0

"Society is the term to describe human beings together (collective, the sum of their social networks and power networks). It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but only to those things that everybody acts upon ÛÒ or refuses to do ÛÒ quite reliably.
Because it must keep even the poorest and weakest members of a society willing to help even the richest and strongest, a society is very concerned with its citizenship, rights, ethics and time limits. These are basic ways to achieve fairness. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats.
While every society is different, the way it breaks down and fails is very often the same: fraud, theft, violence, war and sometimes even genocide if people stop identifying with the society and thus identify with what they think of as a ""race"" of people. A new society may be formed out of only those who still agree, or who just survive the collapse of an old failed one.",1

They did not realize that his life was drawing to a close; it was difficult to do so when so much of the former elasticity remained; when he still proclaimed himself 'quite well' so long as he was not definitely suffering. But he was often suffering; one terrible cold followed another. There was general evidence that he had at last grown old. He, however, made no distinct change in his mode of life. Old habits, suspended by his longer imprisonments to the house, were resumed as soon as he was set free. He still dined out; still attended the private view of every, or almost every art exhibition.

"When Willy was two years old, he lived in a red farmhouse with a yard in front of it. The dandelions were very thick there; so that the yard looked yellow, instead of green.
One bright morning Willy's mamma put on his straw hat, and sent him out in the yard to play. She knew the yard had a high fence; and he could not open the gate; so he was safe.
When it was time for him to have a nap, and mamma went to call him, she noticed that a great many of the dandelions were gone. She wondered where they were; but, as Willy could not talk much, she did not ask him about them.
A short time after, while Willy was asleep in his crib, his mamma went out to draw some water. When the bucket came up full of water, the top was all yellow with dandelions. Looking down into the well, she could see no water at all, only dandelions.
It was no wonder, then, where the blossoms had gone. Willy had been very busy trying to fill up the well!",0
"  Graph neural networks (GNNs) and label propagation represent two interrelatedmodeling strategies designed to exploit graph structure in tasks such as nodeproperty prediction. The former is typically based on stacked message-passinglayers that share neighborhood information to transform node features intopredictive embeddings. In contrast, the latter involves spreading labelinformation to unlabeled nodes via a parameter-free diffusion process, butoperates independently of the node features. Given then that the materialdifference is merely whether features or labels are smoothed across the graph,it is natural to consider combinations of the two for improving performance. Inthis regard, it has recently been proposed to use a randomly-selected portionof the training labels as GNN inputs, concatenated with the original nodefeatures for making predictions on the remaining labels. This so-called labeltrick accommodates the parallel use of features and labels, and is foundationalto many of the top-ranking submissions on the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)leaderboard. And yet despite its wide-spread adoption, thus far there has beenlittle attempt to carefully unpack exactly what statistical properties thelabel trick introduces into the training pipeline, intended or otherwise. Tothis end, we prove that under certain simplifying assumptions, the stochasticlabel trick can be reduced to an interpretable, deterministic trainingobjective composed of two factors. The first is a data-fitting term thatnaturally resolves potential label leakage issues, while the second serves as aregularization factor conditioned on graph structure that adapts to graph sizeand connectivity. Later, we leverage this perspective to motivate a broaderrange of label trick use cases, and provide experiments to verify the efficacyof these extensions.",2
"We constantly link different things together: new kids and their names, faces and voices, green eggs and ham. How does our brain achieve this? The purpose of this study was to understand how the brain creates these links. What happens in brain cells when we learn that two things (e.g., a new kid and her name) go together? In an experiment we asked human participants to learn to link different items together. As the participants learned these links, we found that nerve cells in their brains also linked these items together. These nerve cells were found in a region of the brain called the hippocampus. In this article, we will first explain how it is possible to listen to nerve cells in the human brain. Then we will show some examples of the responses of these nerve cells, and finally, how the cells can link different items together.",0
"  Virtual flow metering (VFM) is a cost-effective and non-intrusive technologyfor inferring multiphase flow rates in petroleum assets. Inferences about flowrates are fundamental to decision support systems that operators extensivelyrely on. Data-driven VFM, where mechanistic models are replaced with machinelearning models, has recently gained attention due to its promise of lowermaintenance costs. While excellent performances in small sample studies havebeen reported in the literature, there is still considerable doubt about therobustness of data-driven VFM. In this paper, we propose a new multi-tasklearning (MTL) architecture for data-driven VFM. Our method differs fromprevious methods in that it enables learning across oil and gas wells. We studythe method by modeling 55 wells from four petroleum assets and compare theresults with two single-task baseline models. Our findings show that MTLimproves robustness over single-task methods, without sacrificing performance.MTL yields a 25-50% error reduction on average for the assets where single-taskarchitectures are struggling.",2

"Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere.

Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles.

"  Ion channels are proteins with holes down their middle that control the flowof ions and electric current across otherwise impermeable biological membranes.The flow of sodium, potassium, calcium (divalent), and chloride ions have beencentral issues in biology for more than a century. The flow of current isresponsible for the signals of the nervous system that propagate over longdistances (meters). The concentration of divalent calcium ions is a 'universal'signal that controls many different systems inside cells. The concentration ofdivalent calcium and other messenger ions has a role in life rather like therole of the voltage in different wires of a computer. Ion channels also helpmuch larger solutes (e.g., organic acid and bases; perhaps polypeptides) tocross membranes but much less is known about these systems. Ion channels canselect and control the movement of different types of ions because the holes inchannel proteins are a few times larger than the (crystal radii of the) ionsthemselves. Biology uses ion channels as selective valves to control flow andthus concentration of crucial chemical signals. For example, the concentrationof divalent calcium ions determines whether muscles contract or not. Ionchannels have a role in biology similar to the role of transistors in computersand technology.

"It was characteristic of Tom Slade that he liked to go off alone occasionally for a ramble in the woods. It was not that he liked the scouts less, but rather that he liked the woods more. It was his wont to stroll off when his camp duties for the day were over and poke around in the adjacent woods.
The scouts knew and respected his peculiarities and preferences, particularly those who were regular summer visitors at the big camp, and few ever followed him into his chosen haunts. Occasionally some new scout, tempted by the pervading reputation and unique negligee of Uncle Jeb's young assistant, ventured to follow him and avail himself of the tips and woods lore with which the more experienced scout's conversation abounded when he was in a talking mood.

"Herd behavior in humans is frequently observed at times of danger and panic; for example, a fire in a building often causes herd behavior, with people often suspending their individual reasoning and fleeing together in a pack. People in a crisis that requires escape will attempt to move faster than normal, copy the actions of others, interact physically with each other, and ignore alternative strategies in favor of following the mass escape trend.
Another commonly cited example of human herd behavior is the phenomenon of stock market bubbles. Large stock market trends often begin and end with a mass frenzy of buying (bubbles) or selling (crashes). Many observers see these stock market trends as examples of herding behavior because individuals are driven by emotion rather than reason to ""join the crowd""; greed drives mass buying frenzies, and fear drives crashes.
A more obvious example of human herd behavior occurs in dense public crowds or mobs. Crowds that gather because of a grievance or protest can involve herding behavior that becomes violent.

Billie handed over the glass without a word and stood expectant, while Donald scrutinized closely a body of horsemenÛÓtwenty or more in numberÛÓwhich had halted beside the railroad that connects the little city of Pachuca with the City of Mexico.
""They are not soldiers, that's certain,"" was Donald's comment after he had inspected the riders carefully for a couple of minutes.
""That's what I thought,"" from Billie. ""They look like a bunch of vaqueros to me; but what would a crowd of fifty cowpunchers be doing in a country where the only cattle are goats?""",1
"It was quite a long walk to the storeÛÓthe store, because the village only boasted one. That did not matter much to the inhabitants generally, as the town was so near. Bentleyville and Bentley were connected by a straggling line of houses that made it hard to tell where the village ended and the town began. Ambitious young villagers took advantage of this to talk about ""we city people,"" while the older ones contentedly spoke of themselves as ""plain country-folks.""
Nannie did not care in the least which she was, neither did she greatly mind the walk, though the feet that had done so much running began to grow tired. If only she could carry a peace-offering to Aunt Samantha! That would make all right, and her small world bright again, she was sure.
""I can't have any candy or slate-pencils for ever so long; but I don't care, 'cause I do like her, and she'll know itÛÓcourse she will if I buy her a handkerchief; and she wont think I got all mussed up on purpose,"" she soliloquized.",1
"I live in a house. It shelters us from the rain, wind and sun. We have cups in our house. We use them to drink water, tea, juice and smoothies. We have flowers in our garden.

"In the lake floated a large tulip leaf. This was Thumbelina's little boat. Seated there she sailed from side to side of her little lake, rowing cleverly with two white horse hairs. As she rowed backward and forward she sang softly to herself. The woman listening heard, and thought she had never known so sweet a song.
And now such a sad thing happened.
In through a broken window-pane hopped a big toadÛÓoh, such an ugly big toad! She hopped right on to the table, where Thumbelina lay dreaming in her tiny cradle, under the pale pink rose leaf.
""How beautiful the little maiden is,"" she croaked. ""She will make a lovely bride for my handsome son."" And she lifted the little cradle, with Thumbelina in it, and hopped out through the broken window-pane, and down into the little garden.
At the foot of the garden was a broad stream. Here, under the muddy banks, lived the old toad with her son.",0
"  We consider the Constrained-degree percolation model in random environment onthe square lattice. In this model, each vertex $v$ has an independent randomconstraint ${\kappa}_v$ which takes the value $j\in \{0,1,2,3\}$ withprobability $\rho_j$. Each edge $e$ attempts to open at a random uniform time$U_e$ in $[0,1]$, independently of all other edges. It succeeds if at time$U_e$ both its end-vertices have degrees strictly smaller than theirrespectively attached constraints. We show that this model undergoes anon-trivial phase transition when $\rho_3$ is sufficiently large. The proofconsists of a decoupling inequality, the continuity of the probability forlocal events, and a coarse-graining argument.",2
"  In this work, we study policy-based methods for solving the reinforcementlearning problem, where off-policy sampling and linear function approximationare employed for policy evaluation, and various policy update rules, includingnatural policy gradient (NPG), are considered for policy update. To solve thepolicy evaluation sub-problem in the presence of the deadly triad, we propose ageneric algorithm framework of multi-step TD-learning with generalizedimportance sampling ratios, which includes two specific algorithms: the$\lambda$-averaged $Q$-trace and the two-sided $Q$-trace. The generic algorithmis single time-scale, has provable finite-sample guarantees, and overcomes thehigh variance issue in off-policy learning.  As for the policy update, we provide a universal analysis using only thecontraction property and the monotonicity property of the Bellman operator toestablish the geometric convergence under various policy update rules.Importantly, by viewing NPG as an approximate way of implementing policyiteration, we establish the geometric convergence of NPG without introducingregularization, and without using mirror descent type of analysis as inexisting literature. Combining the geometric convergence of the policy updatewith the finite-sample analysis of the policy evaluation, we establish for thefirst time an overall $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity forfinding an optimal policy (up to a function approximation error) usingpolicy-based methods under off-policy sampling and linear functionapproximation.",2
"A little pine tree was in the woods.
It had no leaves. It had needles.
The little tree said, ""I do not like needles. All the other trees in the woods have pretty leaves. I want leaves, too. But I will have better leaves. I want gold leaves.""
Night came and the little tree went to sleep. A fairy came by and gave it gold leaves.
When the little tree woke it had leaves of gold.
It said, ""Oh, I am so pretty! No other tree has gold leaves.""
Night came.
A man came by with a bag. He saw the gold leaves. He took them all and put them into his bag.
The poor little tree cried, ""I do not want gold leaves again. I will have glass leaves.""
So the little tree went to sleep. The fairy came by and put the glass leaves on it.
The little tree woke and saw its glass leaves.
How pretty they looked in the sunshine! 'No other tree was so bright.
Then a wind came up. It blew and blew.
The glass leaves all fell from the tree and were broken.",0
"Seedlings from the same fruit, and the young of the same litter, sometimes differ considerably from each other, though both the young and the parents, as Muller has remarked, have apparently been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life; and this shows how unimportant the direct effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction, and of growth, and of inheritance; for had the action of the conditions been direct, if any of the young had varied, all would probably have varied in the same manner. To judge how much, in the case of any variation, we should attribute to the direct action of heat, moisture, light, food, etc., is most difficult: my impression is, that with animals such agencies have produced very little direct effect, though apparently more in the case of plants.",1
"What do corn roots have in common with your Facebook profile?
No, that was not the beginning of a joke. The two have more in common than you might think. We often think of a corn plant as a single organism. But plants are part of a network of relationships, sort of such as Facebook. These plant relationships are easy to overlook because they are hard to study. Still, they are very important because they affect how healthy plants are.
Soil is full of millions of microscopic bacteria and fungi. These microscopic organisms are collectively called microbes. Some of these microbes form close partnerships with plants. Plants can rely on microbes to help them get nutrients that are scarce in soil. Microbes break down dead plants and animals, and this process slowly releases nitrogen, phosphorus, and other elements that plants need to grow. When plants cannot get enough of these nutrients on their own, they can send out sugars from their roots. The energy microbes get from these sugars helps them break down even more dead plants and animals. If enough nutrients are available in the soil, though, plants would rather keep their sugars for themselves.",1

When we become too noisy, mother says, ""Now sit quietly and watch TV."" She always adds, ""But only for 30 minutes, while we take a break!"" If we don't have schoolwork, sometimes mother asks me or my older sister to help her. I am not always ready to help. But I do it because I know she works so hard. As we walk home from the shop with the sun setting, we talk about our day. We have to hurry to keep up with her, but we love walking and talking with mother. She makes sure that we do homework and have time to play. She makes sure that we eat vegetables and fruits, and drink water. When we are sick, she cares for us.",0
"There were a number of people out this afternoon, far more than last Sunday. And the band sounded louder and gayer. That was because the Season had begun. For although the band played all the year round on Sundays, out of season it was never the same. It was like someone playing with only the family to listen; it didn't care how it played if there weren't any strangers present. Wasn't the conductor wearing a new coat, too? She was sure it was new. He scraped with his foot and flapped his arms like a rooster about to crow, and the bandsmen sitting in the green rotunda blew out their cheeks and glared at the music.

"  Structure predictions of helical membrane proteins have been designed to takeadvantage of the structural autonomy of secondary structure elements, aspostulated by the two-stage model of Engelman and Popot. In this context, weinvestigate structure calculation strategies for two membrane proteins withdifferent functions, sizes, aminoacid compositions, and topologies: theglycophorin A homodimer (a paradigm for close inter-helical packing in membraneproteins) and aquaporin (a channel protein). Our structure calculations arebased on two alternative folding schemes: a one-step simulated annealing froman extended chain conformation, and a two-step procedure inspired by thegrid-search methods traditionally used in membrane protein predictions. In thisframework, we investigate rationales for the utilization of sparse NMR datasuch as distance-based restraints and residual dipolar couplings in structurecalculations of helical membrane proteins.",2
"Ivan Pavlov was a physiologist studying the digestive system in dogs, when he noticed that the dogs would begin to drool (or ""salivate"") when ordinary things happened around the time when food was coming. Pavlov found that he could train the dogs to drool following a particular cue, like the sound of a bell, by presenting the cue before giving the dogs their food. Over time, the dogs would begin to drool when they heard the cue rather than when they received their food.
This process is not limited to dogs. For example, if you go to an ice cream shop a lot and it smells like strawberries, eventually you might come to form a mental link between the ice cream and the smell of strawberries. The smell of strawberries becomes a cue that could cause you to start salivating at the thought of ice cream. This process of forming mental links between environmental cues and something that is highly motivating, such as a food you like, is called classical conditioning.
Scientist have found that classical conditioning also happens in drug addiction.",0
"  Interval Temporal Logic (ITL) is an established temporal formalism forreasoning about time periods.

We solve the longstanding open problem of finding a completeaxiom system for basic quantifier-free propositional ITL (PITL) with infinitetime for analysing nonterminating computational systems. Our completeness proofuses a reduction to completeness for PITL with finite time and conventionalpropositional linear-time temporal logic. Unlike completeness proofs of equallyexpressive logics with nonelementary computational complexity, our semanticapproach does not use tableaux, subformula closures or explicit deductionsinvolving encodings of omega automata and nontrivial techniques forcomplementing them. We believe that our result also provides evidence of thenaturalness of interval-based reasoning.",2
"About a year after the family moved to Oklahoma, Will Johnson got a neighbor boy to go with him back to their place in Texas to bring another wagon load of household goods. They were gone about two weeks.

Simpson, being about 17 at the time, was not about to go to school to a teacher who was his older brother, so he saddled his horse and slipped away back to Melvin's ranch, to be with his brother Joe. He said he got tired of riding but not nearly as tired as his horse. The journey was about 300 miles. He was on the trail three days and nights and had to stop at times to let his horse rest. When he got to the ranch, Joe wrote to the family saying that Simpson was with him and for them not to worry. They had suspected where he had gone but were not sure.",0
"Ancient Egypt, or the Egyptian Empire, was a society that began about 3150 BC, and lasted until 20 BC when it was invaded by the Roman Empire.
It grew along the River Nile and was at its most powerful in the second millennium BC. Its land went from the Nile delta to Nubia, a kingdom which today is mostly in the Sudan.
For most of its history, Egypt was prosperous, since the water from the Nile made sure that the Egyptians would have good crops. Crops were grown after the Nile flood water went down.
The Egyptians created a way of writing using hieroglyphs, built huge temples and tombs, traded with other areas, and had a powerful army. Their religion had many gods, and its priests were powerful and rich. Their rulers, called Pharaohs, were thought to be close to the gods.",0
"A shepherd's dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him suffer the greatest hunger.

""Those look really delicious,"" he thought. He took a few steps back so that he could make his highest jump. The grapes were too high. Jackal fell on his back without even touching the bunch. Jackal got up and went further back from his starting spot. He ran, and almost got high enough. But he fell, even harder. He tried again and again. But he couldn't get to the grapes. He kept falling until his back was very sore. Finally, he gave up and walked away. He stopped and looked back at the grapes. He was hungrier than ever. ""Those grapes look really sour anyway,"" he thought.",0
"Benjamin Franklin, who was in London in 1760 as agent of the Pennsylvania Assembly, gave the British ministers some wholesome advice on the terms of the peace that should be made with France. The St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes regions, he said, must be retained by England at all costs. Moreover, the Mississippi Valley must be taken, in order to provide for the growing populations of the seaboard colonies suitable lands in the interior, and so keep them engaged in agriculture. Otherwise these populations would turn to manufacturing, and the industries of the mother country would suffer.
The treaty of peace, three years later, brought the settlement which Franklin suggested. The vast American back country, with its inviting rivers and lakes, its shaded hills, and its sunny prairies, became English territory. The English people had, however, only the vaguest notion of the extent, appearance, and resources of their new possession. Even the officials who drew the treaty were as ignorant of the country as of middle Africa.",1
"It is very common for people to think that the brain controls all of the movements that we make. When we think about moving, signals travel from the brain travel down to the spinal cord through nerves (almost like telephone wires). The spinal cord acts like a freeway with many exits in both directions. In one direction, information from the senses travels to the brain, and in the other direction, signals are carried from the brain to control the muscles. The actions of these muscles are what cause the arms and legs to move. However, the brain is not always required to cause movement. By examining animals, scientists discovered that complex groups of cells within the spinal cord can control walking. It turns out that the main job of controlling walking is done by the spinal cord, and not the brain.",0
"But Mt. Erebus isnÛªt just a mountain. It is a volcano. A volcano is an opening in EarthÛªs surface. Melted rock called lava flows out of the opening. When this happens, it is called an eruption. 
There are volcanoes all over the world. Some of them are very old. They do not erupt anymore. But many volcanoes still erupt. Mt. Erebus erupts almost every day! 
Ross Island is a cold place. It is near Antarctica. This means that Mt. Erebus is covered by snow and ice all year long. But the inside of the volcano is very hot. Steam from the inside of the volcano comes out the sides through cracks in the rock. The steam makes the ice melt and forms caves made out of ice. When the hot steam moves into the cold air, it freezes into pillars. They look like icicles that point up into the sky! 
At the top of the volcano is a lake. But this lake isnÛªt made of water. ItÛªs made of lava! Sometimes, a big bubble of gas inside the volcano shoots a big chunk of lava out into the air.",0
"There is, however, a big problem these herbivorous fishes face when they eat algae. It is not easy to digest! Algae, like all living things, are made up of cells, with each specialized for a certain role. The cells of algae hold complex, large chains of sugars, called polysaccharides (pronounced, ""pol-ee-sack-ah-ride""). Different algae have their own, unique composition of these large sugar chains within their cells. To get energy from algae, herbivorous fishes need to break down these large chains. Inside the guts of fish are molecules known as enzymes (think of them as molecular or chemical scissors) that can break these sugar chains into smaller parts fish can absorb into their bodies. There are many different types of these enzymes, functioning like different workers on a construction team. Each enzyme has a specific job in breaking down different parts of algae. However, not all fish have the right kinds of enzymes to break down algae. So, how are they able to get nutrients from algae that are hard to digest?",1
"The magic spell was in Latin, of course; but the princess knew Latin very well, and soon she had the magic song by heart. Then she closed the book and put it back on the shelf. Then she threw open the window and drew back the curtains and put out all the lights except two scented candles that burned with a white fire under a round mirror with a silver frame, opposite the window. And into that mirror the moon shone white and full, filling all the space of it so that the room was steeped in a strange silver light. Now the whole room seemed to sway gently, waving and trembling; and as it trembled it sounded and rang with a low silver music, as if it were filled with the waves of the sea.
Then the princess took a great silver basin, covered with strange black signs and figures raised in the silver. She poured water into the basin, and as she poured it she sang the magic spell from the Latin book.",0
"Like Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease is also a neurodegenerative disease that causes movement problems and affects the basal ganglia. Unlike Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease is a genetic illness. This means that if either parent has the disease, the children are also very likely to have the illness. Huntington's Disease is a result of abnormal protein buildup in brain, which results in neuronal death, causing the movement disorder. Mainly, individuals with this disease will show excessive movement, movement that is generally unwanted and unnecessary. For example, they often have constant vibrating limbs, something that is out of their control. As the disease progresses, people with Huntington's will find it increasingly hard to move the way they want to move.
In any neurodegenerative disease, if neurons are dying, then the brain is getting smaller! This is a serious problem and causes the person to have memory and thinking problems. These problems are a common feature of all neurodegenerative diseases.",1
"The Battle of Saratoga is considered the turning point of the American Revolution. The battle was fought in late 1777. I. It was actually two engagements: the Battle of Freeman's Farm (September 19) and the Battle of Bemis Heights (October 7). The Americans were led by General Horatio Gates. The British were led by General John Burgoyne. On October 17 Burgoyne surrendered his army of nearly 6,000 British soldiers. The American victory helped convince France to come to the aid the Continental Army. It also helped them recognize the United States.
In early 1777, General William Howe asked London to approve his plan to attack Philadelphia. This would destroy the rebel American government. In Canada, General John Burgoyne submitted a plan to move down through New York and meet General Howe at Albany. This would divide the colonies. London approved both plans. Burgoyne began moving down the Hudson River valley from Canada. He split his force into two columns. One, under Colonel Barry St. Leger moved east from Lake Ontario down the Mohawk Valley. They attacked the Americans at Fort Stanwix. The Americans sent two parties to relieve the fort.",1
"  General equilibrium is the dominant theoretical framework for economic policyanalysis at the level of the whole economy. In practice, general equilibriumtreats economies as being always in equilibrium, albeit in a sequence ofequilibria as driven by external changes in parameters. This view is sometimesdefended on the grounds that internal dynamics are fast, while external changesare slow, so that the economy can be viewed as adjusting instantaneously to anychanged conditions. However, the argument has not been presented in a rigorousway. In this paper we show that when conditions are such that: a) economies dorespond essentially instantaneously to external influences; b) the externalchanges are small compared to the values that characterize the economy; and c)the economy's dynamics are continuous and first-order in time (as for Walrasiantatonnement), the resulting economic theory is equivalent to a topologicalfield theory. Because it is a topological theory it has no dynamics in a strictsense, and so perturbatively---that is, when examining dynamics in the regionof a critical point---the field theory behaves as general equilibrium posits.However, the field-theoretic form of the theory admits non-perturbativeinstanton solutions that link different critical points. Thus, in this theory,and in contrast to general equilibrium, the internal dynamics of the modeloccasionally make an appearance in the form of abrupt, noise-driven transitionsbetween critical points.",2
"I was very happy. But when I was eleven years old, I grew tired and weak, and then I couldn't walk. My parents took me to the hospital.

One can see the spadefuls of earth coming up from below the ground level when new trenches are being dug. Although this was in broad daylight, our man thought he would go and see what the Germans were up to, so he hops over the side of his trench and runs forward thirty yards to a ditch and crawls along it some hundred yards or so. He then spots a large shell-hole in the field on one side of the ditch, so doubles off and gets into that and has a good look around. Not satisfied with the point of view, he sprints to a line of willows nearer still to the enemyÛÓwithin 250 yards of them indeedÛÓand proceeds to climb up one of them. While doing this he gets shot through the shoulder.",1
"I have known several cases in which treasure lost by piracy or shipwreck has been recovered after a century or more. Some years ago a company of men from Boston made two cruises to the shoals of the Silver Key on the Bahama Banks, a spot noted for shipwrecks. They had some clue to a treasure-laden ship which had foundered there long ago. The first trip was unsuccessful, but on the second voyage the wreck was found. Divers, armed with modern apparatus, spent several days in the quest, but in vain, until, finally, just as the last diver was about to give the signal to be drawn up, he leaned against what seemed only the barnacle-encrusted end of a beam; but suddenly it gave way, and numbers of golden doubloons rolled out at his feet. Considerable sums rewarded further search in the sand-filled and decaying carcass of the old ship; but exactly how much was realized is known only to the discoverers, who kept the matter secret, and thus evaded paying a great part of the share due to the British crown, in whose dominion the treasure was found.",1
"When rainforests are destroyed, many species cannot survive in these areas and can vanish completely. Every species plays its own specific role within the ecosystem that it lives in. Every species consumes certain resources and is in turn eaten by other organisms higher up in the food chain. All of the organisms in an ecosystem carry out some work that keep ecosystems functioningÛÒfor example, by pollinating plants, helping dead organic matter (dead plants and animals) to decay, or by feeding on other animals. Scientists call these processes ""ecosystem functions."" We do not know all of the species on earth and we certainly do not know what all of them do. But we do know that if we lose species, we are in danger of losing the functions that they carry out. We, as ecologists, are interested in how different organisms interact and how these interactions affect the way that ecosystems function.",0
"Under feudalism, taxes were not paid with money. They were paid in products and services. Presents and taxes had to be given to the lords by their vassals. At harvest time, the vassals gave shares of their crops to the lords. The vassals would grind their grain at the noble's granaries. They would give part of the grain to their lord. When animals were killed for food, part of the meat was given to the lords. The lords promised to give protection, peace, and safety to their vassals.
Manors were completely owned by the nobles. They were given from one generation to another. The noble's firstborn son took it all when his father died. Each manor had its own pasture lands, mill, wine press, church, and village. A manor had to let many people live there. Lords gave their servants food and a place to sleep, but they did not pay their servants money.",1
"Physics became a separate field of study after the scientific revolution. Galileo's experiments helped to create classical physics. Although he did not invent the telescope, he used it when he looked into the night sky. He supported Copernicus' idea that the Earth moved around the Sun (heliocentrism). He also investigated gravity. Isaac Newton used Galileo's ideas to create his three laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. Together these laws explained the motion of falling bodies near the earth and the motion of earth and planets around the sun.
In a couple centuries, the Industrial Revolution was in full swing and many more discoveries were made in many fields of science. The laws of classical physics are good enough to study objects that move much slower than the speed of light, and are not microscopic. When scientists first studied quantum mechanics, they had to create a new set of laws, which was the start of modern physics.",1
"The winters in the latitude of Sullivan's Island are seldom very severe, and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is considered necessary.

Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom, and getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was secreted, unlocked the door and went in. A fine fire was blazing upon the hearth. It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one. I threw off an overcoat, took an arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts.",1

"Coming out of the club, the husband and wife walked all the way home in silence.

He was pleased and satisfied, and at the same time he felt the lack of something; he would have liked to go back to the club and make every one feel dreary and miserable, so that all might know how stale and worthless life is when you walk along the streets in the dark and hear the slush of the mud under your feet, and when you know that you will wake up next morning with nothing to look forward to but vodka and cards. Oh, how awful it is!
And Anna Pavlovna could scarcely walk.... She was still under the influence of the dancing, the music, the talk, the lights, and the noise; she asked herself as she walked along why God had thus afflicted her.",1

"To interpret context in social settings, your brain relies on a network of brain regions, including the frontal, temporal, and insular regions. These regions help you update contextual information when you focus on something (say, the traffic light as you are walking down the street). That information helps you anticipate what might happen next, based on your previous experiences. If there is a change in what you are seeing (as you keep walking down the street, a mean-looking Doberman appears), the frontal regions will activate and update predictions (""this may be dangerous!""). These predictions will be influenced by the context (""oh, the dog is on a leash"") and your previous experience (""yeah, but once I was attacked by a dog and it was very bad!""). If a person's frontal regions are damaged, he or she will find it difficult to recognize the influence of context. Thus, the Doberman may not be perceived as a threat, even if this person has been attacked by other dogs before! The main role of the frontal regions is to predict the meaning of actions by analyzing the contextual events that surround the actions.",1
"You probably know that wind and water can shape EarthÛªs land. But did you know that glaciers can too?
Glaciers are made of ice. Ice is a solid. But glaciers are so large and heavy that they can flow like a river.
Glaciers are found on high mountains. It is cold there, so snow doesnÛªt melt. Instead, the snow piles up and gets squished together, forming ice. Over many years, the ice builds up and forms a glacier.
The glacier becomes so heavy that it slowly moves down the mountains. The glacier scrapes and shapes the mountainsÛª sides as it moves.
Glaciers are also found in the Arctic and in Antarctica. They press and grind the land below as they move.
Glaciers have shaped the world in surprising ways. Millions of years ago, glaciers covered the desert of South Africa. The glaciers slowly moved, scraping across the desertÛªs rocks. Today, we see flat, polished rocks and know that glaciers were once there.",0
"  The Lucas critique has exposed the problem of the trade-off between changesin monetary policy and structural breaks in economic time series. The searchfor and characterisation of such breaks has been a major econometric task eversince. We have developed an integral technique similar to CUSUM using anempirical model quantitatively linking the rate of inflation and unemploymentto the change in the level of labour force in Canada. Inherently, our modelbelongs to the class of Phillips curve models, and the link between theinvolved variables is a linear one with all coefficients of individual andgeneralized models obtained by empirical calibration. To achieve the best LSQfit between measured and predicted time series cumulative curves are used as asimplified version of the 1-D boundary elements (integral) method. The distancebetween the cumulative curves (in L2 metrics) is very sensitive to structuralbreaks since it accumulates true differences and suppresses uncorrelated noiseand systematic errors. Our previous model of inflation and unemployment inCanada is enhanced by the introduction of structural breaks and is validated bynew data in the past and future. The most exiting finding is that theintroduction of inflation targeting as a new monetary policy in 1991 resultedin a structural break manifested in a lowered rate of price inflationaccompanied by a substantial fall in the rate of unemployment. Therefore, thenew monetary policy in Canada is a win-win one.",2
"A wise and just monarch was the good King John. His kingdom extended over Central Italy, and included the famous town of Atri, which in days gone by had been a famous harbour on the shores of the Adriatic. Now the sea had retreated from it, and it lay inland; no longer the crested waves rolled on its borders, or tossed their showers of silver spray to meet the vivid turquoise of the sky.
The great desire of good King John was that every man, woman and child in his dominions should be able to obtain justice without delay, be they rich or poor. To this end, since he could not possibly listen to all himself, he hung a bell in one of the city towers, and issued a proclamation to say that when this was rung a magistrate would immediately proceed to the public square and administer justice in his name. The plan worked admirably; both rich and poor were satisfied, and since they knew that evil-doers would be quickly punished, and wrongs set right, men hesitated to defraud or oppress their neighbours, and the great bell pealed less often as years went on.",1

"Once upon a time the youngest son of a king became filled with the desire to go abroad and see the world. He got his father's permission to depart, kissed his parents good-bye, mounted his black horse, and galloped away down the high road. Soon the gray towers of the old castle in which he was born hid themselves behind him.
The Prince journeyed on, spending the days in traveling, and the nights in little wayside inns, till one day he found himself in the heart of the Adamant Mountains. The great, red granite crags of the surrounding peaks rose out of the gleaming snow like ugly fingers, and the slopes of giant glaciers sparkled in the sun like torrents of diamonds. The Prince sat down by some stunted trees whose tops had long before been broken off by an avalanche, and began to eat the bit of bread and cheese which he had stored in his pocket. His black horse, meanwhile, ate the grass which grew here and there along the mountain path. And as the Prince sat there in the bright sun and the silence of the mountains, he became aware of a low, continuous roaring.",0
"The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant in the United States was marred by many scandals, including Black Friday, corruption in the Department of the Interior, and the Whiskey Ring. (The CrÌ©dit Mobilier scandal, although exposed during his tenure, is not considered a Grant scandal.) Although Grant was not directly involved with these scandals, his associations with people of questionable character and his reliance on cronyism, nepotism, and political patronage gave rise to accusations of ""Grantism"".
The term ""Grantism"" was originally coined by Senator Charles Sumner in a speech on May 31, 1872, a Presidential election year. It was used by Sumner to differentiate the Republican Party from Grant. The two men had been political enemies ever since Sumner's refusal to annex Santo Domingo to the United States. Sumner accused Grant of political patronage, nepotism, and being an autocrat like Julius Caesar.",1

"It was the first Saturday of the regular fall term at Miss Allen's Boarding School. The girls were back again in their old placesÛÓall except the seniors of the previous year, who had graduatedÛÓand now the sophomores were preparing for the first social event of the year, their reception to the freshmen. Marjorie Wilkinson was chairman.
The clock struck seven, and she stood perfectly still in the center of the floor, viewing the result of their work. The bare, ugly gymnasium had disappeared; in its place was a little winter scene from fairyland. Cedar branches, decked with flakes of artificial snow, and great white snowbanks, completely hid the walls from view. Spread over the floor, except for a space in the middle reserved for dancing, were pine needles and more patches of snow; and everywhere frosty tinsel glimmered in the soft, blue light of the covered electric bulbs.
The girls walked lightly and spoke softly, as if they feared that by some rude noise they might break the magic spell of the scene.",0
"After two years of training he went to sea, and entering the regions so well known to his imagination, found them strangely barren of adventure. He made many voyages. He knew the magic monotony of existence between sky and water: he had to bear the criticism of men, the exactions of the sea, and the prosaic severity of the daily task that gives breadÛÓbut whose only reward is in the perfect love of the work. This reward eluded him. Yet he could not go back, because there is nothing more enticing, disenchanting, and enslaving than the life at sea. Besides, his prospects were good. He was gentlemanly, steady, tractable, with a thorough knowledge of his duties; and in time, when yet very young, he became chief mate of a fine ship, without ever having been tested by those events of the sea that show in the light of day the inner worth of a man, the edge of his temper, and the fibre of his stuff; that reveal the quality of his resistance and the secret truth of his pretences, not only to others but also to himself.",1
"As to the scene, it must be remembered that the Egypt of those days was not Egyptian as we understand the word, but rather Greek. Cleopatra herself was of Greek descent. The kingdom of Egypt had been created by a general of Alexander the Great after that splendid warrior's death. Its capital, the most brilliant city of the Greco-Roman world, had been founded by Alexander himself, who gave to it his name. With his own hands he traced out the limits of the city and issued the most peremptory orders that it should be made the metropolis of the entire world. The orders of a king cannot give enduring greatness to a city; but Alexander's keen eye and marvelous brain saw at once that the site of Alexandria was such that a great commercial community planted there would live and flourish throughout out succeeding ages. He was right; for within a century this new capital of Egypt leaped to the forefront among the exchanges of the world's commerce, while everything that art could do was lavished on its embellishment.",1
"It was the boast of a Roman Emperor that he had found the Eternal City brick and left it marble. Similarly the present generation of Americans inherited a country which was wood and have transformed it into steel. That which chiefly distinguishes the physical America of today from that of forty years ago is the extensive use of this metal. Our fathers used steel very little in railway transportation; rails and locomotives were usually made of iron, and wood was the prevailing material for railroad bridges. Steel cars, both for passengers and for freight, are now everywhere taking the place of the more flimsy substance. We travel today in steel subways, transact our business in steel buildings, and live in apartments and private houses which are made largely of steel. The steel automobile has long since supplanted the wooden carriage; the steel ship has displaced the iron and wooden vessel. The American farmer now encloses his lands with steel wire, the Southern planter binds his cotton with steel ties, and modern America could never gather her abundant harvests without her mighty agricultural implements, all of which are made of steel.",1

"A book has been invented for carrying fish-hooks, and it promises to be of great use to all those who find pleasure in the gentle art of angling.
It is a book arranged somewhat like a wallet. At one end is a strong leather pocket for flies, then stretched across it are four ledges. Each ledge has a number of slits in it. At the end opposite the pocket is the first ledge, and into the slits in this ledge the hooks are placed. The short line attached to the hook is carried to the next ledge, and carefully slipped into a slit opposite to the one which holds the hook. The line is carried over another ledge to be finally anchored in the one nearer the pocket. When the book is closed the ledges fit into each other, and the fish-hooks are kept in place and therefore cannot get tangled.",1
"  Cotranslational folding depends on the folding speed and stability of thenascent protein. It remains difficult, however, to predict which proteinscotranslationally fold. Here, we simulate evolution of model proteins toinvestigate how native structure influences evolution of cotranslationalfolding. We developed a model that connects protein folding during and aftertranslation to cellular fitness. Model proteins evolved improved folding speedand stability, with proteins adopting one of two strategies for foldingquickly. Low contact order proteins evolve to fold cotranslationally. Suchproteins adopt native conformations early on during the translation process,with each subsequently translated residue establishing additional nativecontacts. On the other hand, high contact order proteins tend not to be stablein their native conformations until the full chain is nearly extruded. We alsosimulated evolution of slowly translating codons, finding that slowertranslation speeds at certain positions enhances cotranslational folding.Finally, we investigated real protein structures using a previously publisheddataset that identified evolutionarily conserved rare codons in E. coli genesand associated such codons with cotranslational folding intermediates. We foundthat protein substructures preceding conserved rare codons tend to have lowercontact orders, in line with our finding that lower contact order proteins aremore likely to fold cotranslationally. Our work shows how evolutionaryselection pressure can cause proteins with local contact topologies to evolvecotranslational folding.",2
"Then he would say to the next child, ""I am old enough for meat. Here is yours. Wait until you are older."" Each small portion became even smaller. It went like this for all the children.

"Do you believe in time travel? Every time we remember something from the past or imagine something that will happen in the future, we engage in mental time travel. Scientists discovered that, whether we mentally travel back into the past or forward into the future, some of the same brain regions are activated. One of those regions is the hippocampus, a brain structure famous for its role in building long-term memories. Damage to the hippocampus causes memory problems, but it also impairs the ability to imagine future experiences. This brain connection between remembering the past and thinking about the future suggests that memory, planning, and decision-making may be deeply related. The ability to form memories allows us to reminisce about the past. But maybe the ability to form memories also evolved to allow us to think about and plan for the future.",0
"Climate means the usual condition of the temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, and other meteorological elements in an area of the Earth's surface for a long time. Climate is different from weather. Weather is the condition of these elements right now, for shorter periods of time that are up to two weeks.
The latitude, ground, and height can change the climate of a location. It is also important to note if oceans or other large bodies of water are nearby. Climates are most commonly classified by temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification was the KÌ¦ppen climate classification, first made by Wladimir KÌ¦ppen. The Thornthwaite system, which was used from 1948, not only uses temperature and precipitation information, but evapotranspiration too. This makes it useful for studying how many different kinds of animal species there are, and about the things that could happen when climates change. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus more on where the air masses which help make climates come from.",1

Behind them came the chicken, fluttering its wings and trying hard to keep up. Then came the deer, the squirrel, the serpent, the cat, and the rabbit. Last of all came the bear, the beaver, and the hedgehog. Every one traveled as swiftly as he could, for each wished to hear the words of the Great Spirit.

"There were no mice for kitty, and what could she do? She could not sit still. She saw the little soft white chickens running about in the grass, and she thought she would try to catch one. So she crouched down, and, without making a bit of noise, was getting ready for a spring. But the chickens had a dear mother who loved them. When she saw kitty creeping along, she knew that they were in danger: so she flew at kitty, and made a dreadful noise that scared her away.
Then kitty saw a great butterfly flying along in the air. By and by it flew down upon a flower. Kitty sprang and caught it in her mouth. Then she saw a pretty bird on a bush, singing as hard as he could sing. Kitty crept along under the bush, like a sly little rogue. But the bird saw her coming, and flew away. One day a bee was coming home with honey. Kitty saw the bee, and caught it in her mouth. I think she will not try to catch any more bees. Can you guess why?",0
"This unlucky nestling had not long sat in this way before some boys, who had brought the haymakers their dinners, and were returning home, saw him in the hedge, and immediately began to try to catch him. But though he could not fly, he could flutter, and if he was not able to run, at least he could hop; so every time one of the boys got near to him, the nestling scrambled on to the next bough, and thus from bough to bough all along the hedge. If the boys had only known how dreadfully frightened the poor little bird was, they never could have been so cruel as to hunt him in this way. They did not know this, however, and only thought of catching him. At last he had got to the end of the hedge, and then went fluttering down upon the field with the boys after him. They soon were so close to him, as he hopped and fluttered along the short grass, that the poor little fellow felt their hands would presently be upon him, and as a last chance of escape, he crept and hid himself under a wisp of hay.",1

"Civil rights are rights that all people in a country have. The civil rights of a country apply to all the citizens within its borders. These rights are given by the laws of the country. Civil rights are sometimes thought to be the same as natural rights.
In many countries civil rights include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and freedom of assembly. Civil rights also include the right to own property and the right to get fair and equal treatment from the government, from other citizens, and from private groups. They may prevent against discrimination based on race, sexual orientation and gender.
Civil rights are protected by law and custom. The constitutions of many democracies have a ""Bill of Rights"" that describes the people's liberties and rights. A well-known example is the United States Bill of Rights.
A court of law decides if a person's civil rights have been violated. The courts also decide the limits of civil rights, so that people do not use their freedoms to take away the rights of other people.",0
"  We develop a new extreme value theory for repeated cross-sectional and paneldata to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals (CIs) forconditional extremal quantiles from a fixed number $k$ of nearest-neighbor tailobservations. As a by-product, we also construct CIs for extremal quantiles ofcoefficients in linear random coefficient models. For any fixed $k$, the CIsare uniformly valid without parametric assumptions over a set of nonparametricdata generating processes associated with various tail indices. Simulationstudies show that our CIs exhibit superior small-sample coverage and lengthproperties than alternative nonparametric methods based on asymptoticnormality. Applying the proposed method to Natality Vital Statistics, we studyfactors of extremely low birth weights. We find that signs of major effects arethe same as those found in preceding studies based on parametric models, butwith different magnitudes.",2

"Willy is very fond of playing horse, but has no brother to play with him. His sister Edith, three years old, does not like to play horse: she prefers to be with her dollies. Sometimes Willy gets cross, and scolds at her because she will not play horse as much as he wants her to.
A few days ago I saw Willy coming up from the cellar with a large red apple in his hand; and soon after I heard the two children racing through the rooms, having a merry time; and Willy called out, ""O mamma! I gave Edie an apple, and she did play horse.""
You see, he had thought about that story, and made up his mind to try to coax little sister, as the man did the horse: he soon found that kind words and deeds were better than scolding.
I hope he will not forget it very soon.",0
"  With the rise of contrastive learning, unsupervised graph representationlearning has been booming recently, even surpassing the supervised counterpartsin some machine learning tasks. Most of existing contrastive models for graphrepresentation learning either focus on maximizing mutual information betweenlocal and global embeddings, or primarily depend on contrasting embeddings atnode level. However, they are still not exquisite enough to comprehensivelyexplore the local and global views of network topology. Although the formerconsiders local-global relationship, its coarse global information leads togrudging cooperation between local and global views. The latter pays attentionto node-level feature alignment, so that the role of global view appearsinconspicuous. To avoid falling into these two extreme cases, we propose anovel unsupervised graph representation model by contrasting clusterassignments, called as GRCCA. It is motivated to make good use of local andglobal information synthetically through combining clustering algorithms andcontrastive learning. This not only facilitates the contrastive effect, butalso provides the more high-quality graph information. Meanwhile, GRCCA furtherexcavates cluster-level information, which make it get insight to the elusiveassociation between nodes beyond graph topology. Specifically, we firstgenerate two augmented graphs with distinct graph augmentation strategies, thenemploy clustering algorithms to obtain their cluster assignments and prototypesrespectively. The proposed GRCCA further compels the identical nodes fromdifferent augmented graphs to recognize their cluster assignments mutually byminimizing a cross entropy loss. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we comparewith the state-of-the-art models in three different downstream tasks. Theexperimental results show that GRCCA has strong competitiveness in most tasks.",2
"  In this and the associated article 'BioBlender: A Software for IntuitiveRepresentation of Surface Properties of Biomolecules', (Andrei et al) wepresent BioBlender as a complete instrument for the elaboration of motion(here) and the visualization (Andrei et al) of proteins and othermacromolecules, using instruments of computer graphics. A vast number ofprotein (if not most) exert their function through some extent of motion.Despite recent advances in higly performant methods, it is very difficult toobtain direct information on conformational changes of molecules. However,several systems exist that can shed some light on the variability ofconformations of a single peptide chain; among them, NMR methods providecollections of a number of static 'shots' of a moving protein. Starting fromthis data, and assuming that if a protein exists in more than 1 conformation itmust be able to transit between the different states, we have elaborated asystem that makes ample use of the computational power of 3D computer graphicstechnology. Considering information of all (heavy) atoms, we use animation andgame engine of Blender to obtain transition states. The model we chose toelaborate our system is Calmodulin, a protein favorite among structural anddynamic studies due to its (relative) simplicity of structure and smalldimension. Using Calmodulin we show a procedure that enables the building of a'navigation map' of NMR models, that can help in the identification ofmovements. In the process, a number of intermediate conformations is generated,all of which respond to strict bio-physical and bio-chemical criteria. TheBioBlender system is available for download from the websitewww.bioblender.net, together with examples, tutorial and other useful material.",2

"An inkpad is a small box which contains a pad of cloth or other material. It is impregnated with ink (the pad is inky). A marker is pressed onto the pad, then onto paper. Any raised marks on the pad leave an impression in ink on the paper.
Ink pads are used with rubber stamps. On the stamp is the symbol of an organization, for example. After a form has been passed by an official, it is stamped to show it is authentic. Another variation is a date stamp, placed on all letters which arrive in the building. Another version is a stamp with a facsimile (copy) of an official's signature. Using this, staff can send out letters when the official is not present. Rubber stamps and ink pads have been used for at least a hundred years by civil servants and businesses. They are still in use in many countries but are gradually being replaced with other systems.",0
"You probably know of many animals in which the males and females look very different. Male lions, for example, have beautiful manes, while lioness do not. In birds, males tend to be beautifully colored, while the females are notÛÓjust think of ducks, chicken, or peacocks. But do you know how to distinguish spider-men and -women? Usually, female spiders are bigger, but only if they are well-fed. Females can also be a different color than the males of their species, but this is not true for all species. You can use another really safe trick to identify a male spider. In front of their four walking legs, both spider males and females have another pair of appendages, the pedipalps. The pedipalps are used for many of the spider skills explained above, like feeding, sensing, catching prey, and mating. And exactly on the tip of these pedipalps only adult male spiders have a specialized organ, which looks like boxing gloves.",0
"""What happened to my spinach?"" she demanded to know. Sipho was so scared that he could not talk. While they were standing in the garden, Thabo arrived. ""Thabo, do you know anything about my spinach?"" asked grandmother. ""No, grandmother. I don't know anything about the spinach,"" replied Thabo. ""Did you two boys leave the gate open? I told you never to leave it open."" ""No, grandmother!"" said the boys with one voice. The two boys started to blame each other. They began to argue. Grandmother heard them arguing and called them. Grandmother asked them what they were arguing about. The boys told her the truth about the spinach. They admitted to grandmother that they had left the gate open. They were very sorry. Grandmother was very kind. In a calm voice she said, ""I hope you two boys have learned your lesson. You must never leave the gate open again.""",0
"One beautiful morning in October the sun came up rejoicing. Dotty Dimple watched it from the window with feelings of peculiar pleasure.
""I should think that old sun would wear out and grow rough round the edges. Why not? Last week it was ever so dull; now it is bright. I shouldn't wonder if the angels up there have to scour it once in a while.""
You perceive that Dotty's ideas of astronomy were anything but correct. She supposed the solar orb was composed of a very peculiar kind of gold, which could be rubbed as easily as Norah's tin pans, though so intensely hot that one's fingers would, most likely, be scorched in the operation.
On this particular morning she felt an unusual interest in the state of the weather. It had been decided that she should go West with her father, and this was the day set for departure. ""I am happy up to my throat:"" so she said to Prudy. And now all this happiness was to be buttoned up in a cunning little casaque, with new gaiters at the feet, and a hat and rosette at the top.",1
"Happy Jack hopped up as if he meant to begin the chase again, but he had a pain in his side from running so hard and so long, and so he sat down again. Right down in his heart Happy Jack knew that Chatterer was right, that the tree didn't belong to him any more than to his cousin. But when he thought of all those big, fat nuts with which the tall hickory tree had been loaded, greedy thoughts chased out all thoughts of right and he said to himself again, as he had said when he first saw his cousin, that Chatterer shouldn't have one of them. He stopped scolding long enough to steal a look at them, and thenÛÓwhat do you think Happy Jack did? Why, he gave such a jump of surprise that he nearly lost his balance. Not a nut was to be seen!

"All of the Greeks knew that they were setting out on a dangerous enterprise, but to the Spartans it meant more than that. Leonidas himself felt that he was going to his death, for the oracle at Delphi had foretold that Sparta should be saved if one of her kings should perish, and Leonidas was more than willing to make this sacrifice for his state. His three hundred followers, trained from childhood to look upon death as infinitely preferable to defeat, had, with that courage which has made their name an epithet indicating the highest sort of bravery, celebrated their funeral games before setting out. When they came to the pass of Thermopylae, they found a new cause for fear. This was the path which led over the mountains, and which made possible a descent of the enemy to the rear of those stationed in the pass. However, Leonidas was assured that this mountain track was practically unknown, and that the entrance to it was very difficult to find; so when he had sent a band of Phocians to guard it, he thought little more about it.",1
"Some weeks passed by before Nellie was allowed to take the little fellow in her arms; but, when she was permitted to do this, it seemed to her that she had never felt such delight before. When he would put up his tiny hands, and feel of her face, she was ready to weep with joy.
But one night the nurse was ill; and there was nobody to take care of the baby. Nellie begged so hard to be allowed to sit up and attend to it, that she was at last permitted to do so. She passed two hours, watching baby as he slept, and thinking of the nice times she would have with him when he grew up.
At last he awoke; and then Nellie gave him some milk from the porringer, and tried to rock him to sleep again. But the little fellow wanted a frolic: so she had to take him in her arms, and walk about the room with him.",0
  This paper provides new uniform rate results for kernel estimators ofabsolutely regular stationary processes that are uniform in the bandwidth andin infinite-dimensional classes of dependent variables and regressors.

"Madam Chartley had welcomed many types of girls to her school and was familiar with every shade of embarrassment, but she had never been greeted with quite such an outburst as this. Desperate to make herself understood, Mary began in the middle of her carefully planned speech and breathlessly explained backward, as to why she had arrived at this inopportune time. The explanation was so characteristic of her, so heart-felt and utterly honest, that it revealed far more than she intended and opened a wide door into Madam's sympathies. As she stood looking down at the girl with grave kind eyes, Mary suddenly became aware of a strangely comforting thing. This was not an awesome personage, but a dear adorable being who could understand. The discovery made the second part of her explanation easier. She plunged into it headlong as soon as they were seated.",1
"Some rivers are peaceful in the winter. Some rivers are small and shy in the summer. Some rivers roar angrily in the monsoons. A river may be brown, grey, black, blue, green or several other shades. They change their colour based on what's inside them or what's around them. Sometimes they are the colour of the rocks at the bottom of the river. Sometimes they match the colour of the sky. Rivers also change their course. If a river is in one spot in the past, it may be somewhere else in the future. Many rivers like the Ganga are thousands of years old. They have seen humankind grow up. People have always loved living and working near rivers. Rivers know how to take care of people. Some of our food comes from rivers and river water is used to grow most food. When the food has made its way through the body, rivers to the rescue again! If rivers could speak, they might demand people dump their poop somewhere else. Humans aren't the only creatures rivers look after. Many birds and plants, animals and fishes, insects and flowers rely on rivers.",0
"Where do we feel empathy and how does it work? Well, everything we feel or do is controlled by the brain. So, when you feel empathy, your brain is generating this feeling by activating certain areas of the brain that are important for empathy. Research on empathy shows that one of the major areas of the brain that is activated when you see a friend in pain is an area that scientists call S1. This area of the brain is not only responsible for empathy, but it is also active when you are in pain yourself. For instance, if you hit your knee, the S1 area also activates. This is very interesting, because it means that the pain you actually feel in your body may be similar to the empathy you feel for a friend's pain. In other words, this may mean that when you see your friend in pain, your brain activates as if you yourself were in pain. This is why sometimes it feels painful to see someone else in pain.",0
"George is never so happy as when he is on Grandpa's knee; and the first thing that Grandpa has to do, when little George is seated there, is to pull out his watch.

Grandpa and George are good friends, because Grandpa tries to explain things to him. One day he brought home a watch and gave it to the little boy for his own, and showed him how to wind it up, and make it tick.

"The immune system is the body's way of protecting itself from bad germs. The immune system uses many different strategies to fight and kill troublesome invaders. If you become immunocompromised, meaning you have a weak immune system, you may not be able to protect yourself from bad microbes. Most fungi only infect people who are immunocompromised. Fungi also love growing on plastics and other materials! These surfaces allow the fungi to form very strong biofilms, which are communities of fungi living under a protective shield that blocks the immune system from attacking it and also prevents antifungals from killing the fungal cells living insideÛÓthink of the shield that protects Wakanda in the movies Black Panther and Infinity War. When fungi form these biofilms, the immune system and drugs cannot penetrate the shield! Fungi can also leave the biofilm and travel to other parts of the body to start a new infection. Imagine a fungus living in a biofilm that is growing inside the catheter (IV tube) in someone's vein. This catheter is connected to a highway in the body, the circulatory system.",1
"Weather describes the day to day changes in the atmosphere around us. The atmosphere is the air that surrounds Earth. The air that is around you right now is part of the atmosphere. Each day the weather changes. Sometimes it is hot. Other times we have snow storms. Weather keeps you guessing. It makes every day an adventure. Whatever the weather is doing now, it could be doing something else in a matter of hours. Weather also can vary from place to place. Sometimes the places are very close together. It could be raining at your house, but dry at school a few blocks away. Weather is very tough to predict. Will it rain tomorrow? Maybe it will be sunny. What about the wind? How cold will it be? Those are all questions we want to know. Meteorologists are scientists who study weather and weather prediction. Meteorologists measure many different weather conditions to describe and predict the weather. Temperature measures how hot or cold the air is around us. To describe the wind, we measure wind speed and wind direction. The wind direction tells us where the wind is coming from. We also measure precipitation.",0
"Alice was the youngest of the Parlin family. When Grandma Read called the children into the kitchen, and told them about their new little sister, Susy danced for joy; and Prudy, in her delight, opened the cellar door, and fell down the whole length of the stairs. However, she rolled as softly as a pincushion, and was not seriously hurt.
""But you can't go into mother's room,"" said Susy, ""you're crying so hard.""

"""Give the assembly call, Number Three!""
Presently, in answer to Paul's order, the clear, sweet notes of a bugle sounded through the big gymnasium under the church. More than a score of lads of all sizes began to pass in from the outside, where they had been chattering like so many magpies; for it was now Summer, with vacation at hand.
After telling the bugler to sound the call for the meeting, Paul, who often had charge in place of the regular scoutmaster, Mr. Gordon, watched the coming of the boys through the open basement door.
""Everybody on hand tonight, I guess, Paul,"" observed his chum Jack, as he laid his hand on the shoulder of the leader of the Red Fox patrol.

"Irrigation is when people add water to plants, to help them grow when there is not enough rain. Irrigation water can be pumped from rivers, natural lakes or lakes created by dams, from wells or allowed to flow to the fields by the force of gravity along pipes or open canals.
Irrigation water can be applied to the plants from above by sprinklers that throw water out under pressure, or from watering cans. In sprinkler irrigation, water is moved through pipes to sprinklers scattered around and within the field. Center pivot irrigation is a type of sprinkler irrigation. In drip irrigation water is brought to the plants via pipes having small holes or special emitters spaced along the pipe.
Surface methods allow water to flow onto the soil surface from canals or pipes. Traditional methods allow water to flow over the entire surface of the field, but drip irrigation allows water to be directed to the roots of each plant and much less water is lost by soaking into the ground.",1
"Social exclusion refers to the experience of being socially isolated, either physically (for example, being totally alone), or emotionally (for example, being ignored or told that one is unwanted). When someone excludes you, you probably feel bad or even experience ""painful"" feelings. Why does social exclusion cause these feelings? One possibility is that human beings are social animals, and we have been selected by evolution to live together with others. Social exclusion tells us that social relationships are threatened or damaged, and therefore, exclusion tells us there is a crisis, by causing aversive feelings. Previous research by psychologists (people who study the mind and behavior) and social neuroscientists (people who study the neural, hormonal, cellular, and gametic mechanisms underlying social interaction and behavior) has revealed much about what happens during and after social exclusion. Before beginning to explain how social exclusion dynamically affects our mind, brain, and behavior, I would like to briefly introduce the mystery of social painÛÓdefined as the painful feeling caused by social exclusion.",1

"There was a girl named Ayanda. Ayanda was the only child of her parents. Her mother and father wanted to separate. Ayanda decided to run away from home. She went to the forest because she did not know where else to go. A wolf in the forest chased Ayanda, so she climbed a tree. The wolf tried to bite her, so she climbed higher. At the top of the tree, Ayanda saw the beautiful sun. She fell in love with the sun and decided to stay in the forest. Ayanda climbed the tree every day to talk to the sun. The sun became her family. One day, Ayanda saw a man under the tree. The man was her father. Ayanda came down from the tree and her father explained why he was there.

"Once long ago, the birds had a meeting. They wanted a king, just like people and animals. Which bird should be king? 
""Eagle, he is strong and kingly!"" said one bird. ""No, he has no crown, and when he calls, he sounds too sad,"" said another. ""Then Ostrich, because he is the largest and roars like a lion,"" one called out. ""No, he can't fly. The king of the birds must be able to fly.""

"One day the children put the baby under a tree in the shade on a bright red blanket. They went to play. The baby began crying as usual. A group of cranes flew above the playground and felt sorry for the crying baby. They tried to get the children to notice that the baby was crying but the children kept on playing. The cranes decided to take the baby and raise it themselves. 
Four cranes came to pick up the baby from under the tree. Each crane took a corner of the baby's blanket, lifted the baby up and flew away. The children did not notice anything because they were busy playing. The children's parents were working hard in the hot sun. It was so hot that the mother decided to rest under a tree. While she was resting she heard her baby crying. She looked around and she could not see anything. Then she looked up and she saw four cranes flying away with her baby in the bright red blanket. She screamed and chased after the cranes. When the woman told her husband what she saw he did not believe her.",0
"By this time the sun was about to set, and all of a sudden the sky became as dark as if it had been covered with a thick cloud. I was much astonished at this sudden darkness, but much more when I found it occasioned by a bird of a monstrous size, that came flying toward me. I remembered that I had often heard mariners speak of a miraculous bird called the roc, and conceived that the great dome which I so much admired must be its egg. In short, the bird alighted, and sat over the egg. As I perceived her coming, I crept close to the egg, so that I had before me one of the legs of the bird, which was as big as the trunk of a tree. I tied myself strongly to it with my turban, in hopes that the roc next morning would carry me with her out of this desert island. After having passed the night in this condition, the bird flew away as soon as it was daylight, and carried me so high that I could not discern the earth; she afterward descended with so much rapidity that I lost my senses.",1
"There once lived in a small town in China a man named Hok Lee. He was a steady, industrious man, who not only worked hard at his trade, but did all his own housework as well, for he lived alone. ""What an excellent, industrious man is this Hok Lee!"" said his neighbors. ""How hard he works! He never leaves his house to amuse himself or to take a holiday as others do!""
But Hok Lee was by no means the virtuous person his neighbors thought him. True, he worked hard enough by day, but at night, when all respectable folk were fast asleep, he used to steal out and join a dangerous band of robbers, who broke into rich people's houses and carried off all they could lay hands on.
This state of things went on for some time, and though a thief was caught now and then and punished, no suspicion ever fell on Hok Lee, he was such a very respectable, hard-working man.",0

"  Antibiotics such as the quinolones and fluoroquinolones kill bacterialpathogens ultimately through DNA damage. They target the essential type IIAtopoisomerases in bacteria by stabilising the normally transient double strandbreak state which is created to modify the supercoiling state of the DNA. Herewe discuss the development of these antibiotics and their method of action.Existing methods for DNA damage visualisation, such as the comet assay andimmunofluorescence imaging can often only be analysed qualitatively and thisanalysis is subjective. We describe a putative single-molecule fluorescencetechnique for quantifying DNA damage via the total fluorescence intensity of aDNA origami tile fully saturated with an intercalating dye, along with theoptical requirements for how to implement these into a light microscopy imagingsystem capable of single-molecule millisecond timescale imaging. This systempromises significant improvements in reproducibility of the quantification ofDNA damage over traditional techniques.",2
"When Nick Ribsam set out to find his missing sister Nellie, he made the search as thorough as possible.
The first house at which he stopped was that of Mr. Marston, which, it will be remembered, was only a short distance away from his own home. There, to his disappointment, he learned that their little girl had not been at school that day, and consequently they could tell him nothing.
Without waiting longer than to give a few words of explanation he resumed his trot, and soon after turned into the lane leading to the home of Mr. Kilgore. He found that both Bobby and Sallie had been to school, but they had nothing to tell. When we are more than usually anxious to learn something, it seems that every one whom we meet is stupid beyond endurance.

"  The high level of risk and uncertainty in harnessing oil and gas reservesposes an accounting dilemma in the reporting of reserves quantity information;information which is critical and relied on by investors for decision making.Different studies have indicated that reserves disclosure information isfundamental to understanding the value of the firm. This study attempts tocontribute to the growing value relevance literature on reserves disclosures byexamining the value relevance of the components of oil and gas reserve quantitychange disclosures of upstream oil and gas companies in the London StockExchange. Particularly, it investigates the relationship between averagehistorical share returns and changes in reserves from explorations,acquisitions, production, revisions and sale. It also examines the valuerelevance of the quality of these disclosures. Using archival data from LSE,databases and annual reports, and applying a multifactor framework, theempirical results suggested that changes in reserves as well as the componentsof these changes where associated with share returns though insignificantly dueto the significant impact of oil price and longitudinal effect posed byapplying the measurement approach with utilizes historical returns. However,the quality of reserves disclosures has a positively significant relationshipwith share returns. The volatility and decline in oil price is also reflectedin both low average share returns at -0.4% and low average growth in reservesat 8.94% for the last 8 years in the sector.",2

"The Great Depression was the great economic crisis that started after the U.S. stock market crash in 1929. The prices on the Wall Street stock market fell a lot from October 24 to October 29, 1929. Many people lost their jobs. By 1932, 25ÛÒ30% of people lost their jobs. They became homeless and poor. This ended the wealth of the Roaring Twenties. Many people think that the Great Depression started on Tuesday, October 29, but economists think Black Tuesday was just one of the causes.
From 1929-1932, the depression worsened. Many suspect that increased taxes on American citizens and the increased tariffs (taxes on countries which trade with the United States) worsened it. Economist Milton Friedman said that the Great Depression was worsened because the Federal Reserve printed out less money than usual.
When the Great Depression started, Herbert Hoover was the president of the United States, and as a result, he was blamed for it. People voted for a new president in 1932. His name was Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt got the government to pass many new laws and programs to help people who were hurt by the Great Depression.",1
"Once upon a time, there was a man who had three sons. The youngest son was the cleverest and his father liked him the most. Then the man realised that his two other sons were jealous.

"One old woman especially loved the smells that drifted out of the bakery window every morning. This was Ma Shange who slept on a bench in the park every night. A few weeks before, a kind person had given her the money to buy herself a cinnamon bun. She had taken the bun back to the park and ate it very slowly, licking her lips and sharing the last crumbs with the birds. After that, although the old woman didn't have enough money to buy breakfast, she longed for the delicious bun again. So, every morning she walked slowly past Mr Shabangu's bakery, sniffing the air and smiling blissfully at the mouth-watering smell. Ma Shange's new habit made the baker very angry. As each day went by, he grew angrier and angrier with her. Finally, one winter morning when he was in an especially bad mood, he stormed out of his bakery and grabbed the old woman by the arm.

"  The problem of demand inversion - a crucial step in the estimation of randomutility discrete-choice models - is equivalent to the determination of stableoutcomes in two-sided matching models. This equivalence applies to randomutility models that are not necessarily additive, smooth, nor even invertible.Based on this equivalence, algorithms for the determination of stable matchingsprovide effective computational methods for estimating these models. Fornon-invertible models, the identified set of utility vectors is a lattice, andthe matching algorithms recover sharp upper and lower bounds on the utilities.Our matching approach facilitates estimation of models that were previouslydifficult to estimate, such as the pure characteristics model. An empiricalapplication to voting data from the 1999 European Parliament electionsillustrates the good performance of our matching-based demand inversionalgorithms in practice.",2

So she took it to Dr. Ware; and he was so much pleased, that he took her on his knee and kissed her. But I am not sure that a little tear did not drop on Daisy-flower, as Emma put it into the doctor's hand.",1
"One afternoon when the sun was going down, a mother and her little boy sat at the door of their cottage, talking about the Great Stone Face. They had but to lift their eyes, and there it was plainly to be seen, though miles away, with the sunshine brightening all its features. And what was the Great Stone Face? The Great Stone Face was a work of Nature in her mood of majestic playfulness, formed on the perpendicular side of a mountain by some immense rocks, which had been thrown together in such a position as, when viewed at a proper distance, precisely to resemble the features of the human countenance. It seemed as if an enormous giant, or a Titan, had sculptured his own likeness on the precipice. There was the broad arch of the forehead, a hundred feet in height; the nose, with its long bridge; and the vast lips, which, if they could have spoken, would have rolled their thunder accents from one end of the valley to the other.",1
"Usually, only one person at a time can fit inside an MRI scanner. Thus, it might seem impossible to scan someone's brain during social interaction. But neuroscientists have figured out creative ways around this problem. For example, in one experiment, participants in the scanner were connected to someone in another room through a live video feed, and they played a simple game together. This social interaction led to activation in similar brain regions as those activated in mentalizing studies.
This result could mean that we automatically mentalize whenever we interact with others. However, because the game did not require the players to think about mental states, we cannot be sure that the regions activated during the game were exactly the same regions that the participants use when they mentalize. To clarify this, we designed a new game, in which the players interacted with another person and had to think about mental states.",0
"  In this paper, we introduce variational semantic memory into meta-learning toacquire long-term knowledge for few-shot learning. The variational semanticmemory accrues and stores semantic information for the probabilistic inferenceof class prototypes in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The semantic memoryis grown from scratch and gradually consolidated by absorbing information fromtasks it experiences. By doing so, it is able to accumulate long-term, generalknowledge that enables it to learn new concepts of objects. We formulate memoryrecall as the variational inference of a latent memory variable from addressedcontents, which offers a principled way to adapt the knowledge to individualtasks. Our variational semantic memory, as a new long-term memory module,confers principled recall and update mechanisms that enable semanticinformation to be efficiently accrued and adapted for few-shot learning.Experiments demonstrate that the probabilistic modelling of prototypes achievesa more informative representation of object classes compared to deterministicvectors. The consistent new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarksshows the benefit of variational semantic memory in boosting few-shotrecognition.",2
"Long, long, time ago, all the animals could talk. Mother Mosquito and Baby Mosquito lived in a house. Mother Mosquito always left Baby Mosquito at home when she went to search for food. One day, after Mother left the house, Baby Mosquito decided to see what was happening outside. Later that day, Mother Mosquito came back and found that Baby Mosquito was gone. Mother Mosquito started to panic! She was worried and was going to search for Baby Mosquito. Just then, Baby Mosquito arrived, very excited. ""Mummy, the humans were so happy to see me. They clapped their hands every time I flew past!"" Mother Mosquito was alarmed. ""You say that people were happy and clapping their hands for you?"" ""No, those people were not happy to see you. They were trying to kill you!"" explained Mother. ""Humans are never friends with mosquitoes,"" she warned.",0
"""'Morning, Jeeves,"" I said.
""Good morning, sir,"" said Jeeves. He put the good old cup of tea softly on the table by my bed, and I took a refreshing sip. Just right, as usual. Not too hot, not too sweet, not too weak, not too strong, not too much milk, and not a drop spilled in the saucer. A most amazing cove, Jeeves. So dashed competent in every respect. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I mean to say, take just one small instance. Every other valet I've ever had used to barge into my room in the morning while I was still asleep, causing much misery: but Jeeves seems to know when I'm awake by a sort of telepathy. He always floats in with the cup exactly two minutes after I come to life. Makes a deuce of a lot of difference to a fellow's day.
""How's the weather, Jeeves?"" 
""Exceptionally clement, sir.""
""Anything in the papers?""
""Some slight friction threatening in the Balkans, sir. Otherwise, nothing.""",1
"Robert paused a few moments in the hall. Sounds of voices came from the dining room, showing that the supper was still in progress. He thought of going back there to listen to the talk, but he reflected that the time for youth at the table had passed. They were in their secrets now, and he strolled toward the large room that contained the chest of drawers.
A dim light from an unshuttered window shone into the apartment and it was in his mind to wait there for Tayoga, but he stopped suddenly at the door and stared in astonishment. A shadow was moving in the room, thin, impalpable and noiseless, but it had all the seeming of a man. Moreover, it had a height and shape that were familiar, and it reminded him of the spy, Garay.
He was too much surprised to move, and so he merely stared. Garay knelt before the chest of drawers and began to work at it with a small sharp tool that he drew from his coat. Robert saw, too, that his attention was centered on the third drawer from the top.",1
"When gods and shepherds piped and the stars sang, that was the day of musicians! But the triumph of PhÒbus Apollo himself was not so wonderful as the triumph of a mortal man who lived on earth, though some say that he came of divine lineage. This was Orpheus, that best of harpers, who went with the Grecian heroes of the great ship Argo in search of the Golden Fleece.
After his return from the quest, he won Eurydice for his wife, and they were as happy as people can be who love each other and every one else. The very wild beasts loved them, and the trees clustered about their home as if they were watered with music. But even the gods themselves were not always free from sorrow, and one day misfortune came upon that harper Orpheus whom all men loved to honor.",1
"  This paper derives exponential concentration inequalities and polynomialmoment inequalities for the spectral norm of a random matrix. The analysisrequires a matrix extension of the scalar concentration theory developed bySourav Chatterjee using Stein's method of exchangeable pairs. When applied to asum of independent random matrices, this approach yields matrix generalizationsof the classical inequalities due to Hoeffding, Bernstein, Khintchine andRosenthal. The same technique delivers bounds for sums of dependent randommatrices and more general matrix-valued functions of dependent randomvariables.",2
"Thomas Edison made early phonographs in the 1870s. He originally used tin foil to record the sound. Soon wax cylinders were used in place of the tin foil. The cylinders could be taken off the machine and put back on without destroying the recording. Although discs were made as early as 1888, it was not until 1902 that discs became more popular than cylinder records. Discs were first made of a shellac mixture, and later of polyvinyl chloride, often abbreviated as ""vinyl"". Singles usually carried only one or two songs or recordings. EPs (extended play records) carried from three to five songs. Albums carried many more recordings; a dozen was normal, or from 30 to 45 minutes of playing time. These formats are still used today, with digital recordings, and playing time for singles and albums has grown considerably.
Vinyl records lost popularity but never went out of production. Now, in recent years vinyl is gaining popularity, while CD record shops have gone out of business, more and more vinyl only record shops are opening. Many argue the higher sound quality of vinyl compared to newer formats.",1
"The camp was a half mile back from the water's edge, on a low hillside. Here the men of the outfit were settled. There had been mutinous mutterings among some of the men, but so far there had been no open revolt.
Tom, however, who had had considerable experience in such matters, looked for some form of trouble before the smouldering excitement quieted. So did Harry.
On this dark night Tom had proposed that he and his chum take a stroll down to the shore front to see whether all were well there. Soon after leaving camp behind, the young engineers had started on a jog-trot. Just before they reached the water's edge the wind had borne to their ears the faint report of what must have been an explosion out over the waters of the gulf.
""Trouble!"" Tom whispered in his chum's ear. ""Most likely some of the rascals that we drove out of camp have been trying to set back our work with dynamite. If they have done so we'll teach 'em a lesson if we can catch them!""",1
"Gluck was very much puzzled by the behaviour of his guest; it was such a strange mixture of coolness and humility. He turned away at the string meditatively for another five minutes.
""That mutton looks very nice,"" said the old gentleman, at length. ""Can't you give me a little bit?""
""Impossible, sir,"" said Gluck.
""I'm very hungry,"" continued the old gentleman; ""I've had nothing to eat yesterday, nor today. They surely couldn't miss a bit from the knuckle!""
He spoke in so very melancholy a tone that it quite melted Gluck's heart. ""They promised me one slice today, sir,"" said he; ""I can give you that, but not a bit more.""
""That's a good boy,"" said the old gentleman again.
Then Gluck warmed a plate and sharpened a knife. ""I don't care if I do get beaten for it,"" thought he. Just as he had cut a large slice out of the mutton, there came a tremendous rap at the door. The old gentleman jumped off the hob, as if it had suddenly become inconveniently warm. Gluck fitted the slice into the mutton again, with desperate efforts at exactitude, and ran to open the door.",1
"Once, when Felix had grown to be six years old, his mother took him with her on a journey in the railroad-cars to New York. It was a fine day in June: the windows of the cars were open.
""Felix,"" said his mother, as they took their seats, ""you may sit by the window; but you must not put your head or your arms out of it.""
Before she could explain to him her reasons for saying this, a friend who had come in drew off her attention, by talking to her; so that she forgot to explain to Felix why she did not wish to have him put his head or arms out of the window.
In the seat just before him, Felix saw a large boy, who kept putting his head out, although the boy's mother kept telling him not to do it. By and by the cars rushed by a post, which stood so near the track that it almost grazed the boy's head. He started back in a great fright, losing his hat as he did so. He had a very narrow escape.",0
"One day, Kindru-Lalim remarked, ""O Lali, I'm so tired of living in a dark cave. Why don't we build a house in the forest?"" ""That's a fantastic idea, Kindru!"" exclaimed Kincha Lali-Dam. ""Let's go and ask our friends - the birds, beasts and reptiles - how to build a house!"" So Kincha Lali-Dam and Kindru-Lalim came out of their caves and entered a dense forest. The first animal they saw was an elephant standing under a tree, flapping his large ears. 
 ""Can you tell us how to build a house, O mighty one?"" they asked. The elephant trumpeted loudly and said, ""Cut logs to make pillars as strong and thick as my legs!"" The two friends chopped down a tree and made thick pillars out of it. 
 A snake suddenly slithered past them on the forest floor. ""Fetch poles as long and thin as I am,"" hissed the snake, so off went Kindru-Lalim and Kincha Lali-Dam to cut bamboos from a nearby grove.",1
"For two or three months I kept his wings clipped, so that he could not fly far. When I went out for a walk, I generally took him, either in my arms or perched on my hand; and thus I and my pet became known all over the neighborhood; and, when my little playmates invited me to visit them, an invitation was always sent for ""Lillie and her pigeon.""
He followed me everywhere. If I was reading, he rested on my chair; if playing on the piano, he would listen attentively: indeed he acquired such a taste for music, that the only time he ever seemed willing to leave me was to perch upon the foot of a gentleman who was singing very finely.
I taught him a number of tricks, such as bringing me any thing that he could carry, lying down very still till I told him to get up, and running over the piano-keys to make music for himself.",0
"Squire O'Shanaghgan was a tall, powerfully built man, with deep-set eyes and rugged, overhanging brows; his hair was of a grizzled gray, very thick and abundant; he had a shaggy beard, too, and a long overhanging mustache. He entered the north parlor still more noisily than Nora had done. The dogs yelped with delight, and flung themselves upon him.
""Down, Creena! down, Cushla!"" he said. ""Ah, then, Nora, they are as bewitching as yourself, little woman. What beauties they are growing, to be sure!""
""I reared them,"" said Nora. ""I am proud of them both. At one time I thought Creena could not live; but look at her nowÛÓher coat as black as jet, and so silky.""

Dog paid extra, because he did not have the correct money. The driver was about to give Dog his change. Suddenly Goat ran away without paying. The driver was very annoyed. He drove away without giving Dog his change. That is why, even today, Dog runs towards a car to peep inside. He is looking for the driver who owes him change. Goat runs away from the sound of a car. She is afraid she will be arrested for not paying her fare. Cow is not bothered by cars. Cow takes her time crossing the road. She knows she paid her fare in full.",0
"  Dynamic treatment regimes are treatment allocations tailored to heterogeneousindividuals. The optimal dynamic treatment regime is a regime that maximizescounterfactual welfare. We introduce a framework in which we can partiallylearn the optimal dynamic regime from observational data, relaxing thesequential randomization assumption commonly employed in the literature butinstead using (binary) instrumental variables. We propose the notion of sharppartial ordering of counterfactual welfares with respect to dynamic regimes andestablish mapping from data to partial ordering via a set of linear programs.We then characterize the identified set of the optimal regime as the set ofmaximal elements associated with the partial ordering. We relate the notion ofpartial ordering with a more conventional notion of partial identificationusing topological sorts. Practically, topological sorts can be served as apolicy benchmark for a policymaker. We apply our method to understand returnsto schooling and post-school training as a sequence of treatments by combiningdata from multiple sources. The framework of this paper can be used beyond thecurrent context, e.g., in establishing rankings of multiple treatments orpolicies across different counterfactual scenarios.",2

"Patty well remembered her visit at their summer home which they called the Hurly-Burly, and she could not see that their city residence was any less deserving of the name. Her Aunt Grace and Uncle Ted were jolly, good-natured people, who cared little about system or method in their home. The result was that things often went wrong, but nobody cared especially if they did.
""I meant to have a nicer luncheon for you, Patty,"" said her aunt, as they sat down at the table, ""but the cook forgot to order lobsters, and when I telephoned for fresh peas the grocer said I was too late, for they were all sold. I'm so sorry, for I do love hothouse peas, don't you?""

An erotot from another community came by. He saw the baby. He was surprised. He asked himself, ""Where is the mother?"" He bent down. The sound of the chains on his neck woke the baby. He let the baby play with his chains. The baby laughed as he played. The woman looked down to see why the baby was laughing. She saw the stranger. She was so afraid that she dropped her bag of fruit. The erotot looked up. He said, ""Don't be afraid. I'm only playing with your beautiful baby."" So, the woman came down from the tree. The erotot took off one of his chains. He gave it to the baby.

"There was once upon a time a Queen who had the ugliest little baby imaginable, so ugly, indeed, that it was almost impossible to believe he was a little boy at all.
A fairy, however, assured his mother that the little baby would be very good and clever, saying that she was also giving him a gift which would enable him to make that person whom he loved the best as clever as himself.
This somewhat consoled the Queen, but still she was very unhappy because her son was so ugly, though no sooner had he begun to speak than he could talk about all sorts of things, and he had such pretty ways that people were charmed with him.
I forgot to say, that, when he was quite a baby, he had a funny little tuft of hair on his head, so he was called Tufty Riquet, for Riquet was the family name.",0
"The city of Florence is really where the Renaissance began. In those days, Italy was not one single country. It was lots of little states, all governed in different ways and all fighting or making allies with each other all the time.
Rome was politically powerful because Rome had the Pope, the person in control of the Roman Catholic Church. Because of his very great importance as a spiritual leader, most people and most cities did not want to argue with the Pope, whichever Pope he might be. Because a new pope was elected when the old one died, everyone who was rich and powerful was always hoping it might be a member of their family. It was always a good idea to have several young men in the family trained as priests, just in case. It was also a good idea to be good friends with other rich families. One way to do this was to have lots of daughters and get them to marry rich powerful men from different cities. This was the way that politics worked.",0

They brought along with them a great many beautiful shells; and, sitting down on the moist sand, where the surf wave broke over them, they busied themselves in making a necklace, which they hung round Proserpina's neck. By way of showing her gratitude, the child besought them to go with her a little way into the fields, so that they might gather abundance of flowers, with which she would make each of her kind playmates a wreath.",1
"The development of antibiotics is one of the biggest successes of modern medicine. Antibiotics have saved millions of lives since doctors started using them in the 1940s. Antibiotics have helped humans to have much better lives by successfully treating almost all types of bacterial infections. But like us, bacteria are smart, too! Since the 1940s, bacteria have been developing tactics to overcome the effects of antibiotics, and today we are seeing more and more bacteria that can no longer be killed by antibiotics at all. These have become known as antibiotic-resistant bacteria or ""superbugs,"" and they are a serious threat to the health of people all over the world. If we do not have antibiotics to stop bacterial infections, even something as simple as a small infected cut on the finger could become life-threatening. Therefore, new weapons, in the form of new antibiotics, are needed to treat the infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",0
"Rudolf, the eldest boy, learned to be a carpenter. But, when he was twenty-one years of age, he came into the possession of a large fortune. He married, and thought that he had so much money that he could never spend it all.
But, before he was fifty years of age, the whole of his large possessions had melted away. Some of his stately houses had been burned down; and the insurance-offices had failed. Some men he had trusted had proved dishonest; and many schemes that he had entered upon had turned out badly.
At the age of forty-six, Rudolf Reinhold took up the business of a carpenter, which he had learned between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. He soon became skillful, and turned his attention to building houses in the city of Berlin. So successful was he, that in ten years he was once more a rich man.",0
"Of course all boys are not full of tricks, but the best of them are.

He is the same boy who not long since wrote a note to his father and signed the name ""Daisy"" to it, and got the old man to stand on a corner for two hours waiting for the girl. After that scrape the old man told the boy that he had no objection to innocent jokes, such as would not bring reproach upon him, and as long as the boy confined himself to jokes that would simply cause pleasant laughter, and not cause the finger of scorn to be pointed at a parent, he would be the last one to kick. So the boy has been for three weeks trying to think of some innocent joke to play on his father.",1
"For many people, talking is something that requires little effort. We rarely think about the complicated ways that the brain, jaw, tongue, lips, lungs, and vocal folds work together to produce speech. How might your life be different if it was difficult for you to say your name? For people who stutter, talking is not always easy. In this article, we will discuss what stuttering, a communication disorder or way of speaking that impacts a person's ability to smoothly link sounds and words together, is and why it is an invisible condition. We will also describe ways to support people who stutter.
Stuttering is a communication disorder that affects the fluency, the ability to smoothly link words and sounds together in speech, of a person's speech, which means the ability to smoothly link sounds and words together. No one has perfectly fluent speech. We all produce disfluencies, breaks in fluent speech that are common among all speakers (or breaks in fluent speech), from time to time. For example, it is common to insert words like ""um"" into speech and to repeat words or phrases on occasion.",0
"  A fundamental problem with nonlinear models is that maximum likelihoodestimates are not guaranteed to exist. Though nonexistence is a well knownproblem in the binary choice literature, it presents significant challenges forother models as well and is not as well understood in more general settings.These challenges are only magnified for models that feature many fixed effectsand other high-dimensional parameters. We address the current ambiguitysurrounding this topic by studying the conditions that govern the existence ofestimates for (pseudo-)maximum likelihood estimators used to estimate a wideclass of generalized linear models (GLMs). We show that some, but not all, ofthese GLM estimators can still deliver consistent estimates of at least some ofthe linear parameters when these conditions fail to hold. We also demonstratehow to verify these conditions in models with high-dimensional parameters, suchas panel data models with multiple levels of fixed effects.",2

Interviews between his mother and his employer soon followed, resulting in something for which at first the boy had not dared to hope.

Of course this proposition was accepted; and Bert soon had the satisfaction of seeing the great ambition of his youth accomplished. He had employment which promised to become a profitable business (as indeed it did in a few years, he and the old man proved so useful to each other); and, more than that, he was united once more with his mother and sisters in a happy home where he has since had a good many Thanksgiving dinners.",1

"The human brain needs healthy proteins for the brain cells to work and function properly. There are some proteins that we get from our diets and other proteins that are produced inside our bodies, such as the tau protein. Tau proteins are the connecting pieces that hold brain cells together. Imagine the brain is a Lego city, with thousands of tall buildings, each one representing a brain cell. If a head injury occurs while playing sports, it disrupts the brain cell structures, like an earthquake causing the Lego buildings to fall apart. Continuous hits shake the brain cells, breaking them into smaller pieces and creating a mess that we call protein aggregates. When these aggregates collect within cells, it is difficult for the tau protein to function properly. Think of a traffic jam on the streets between the Lego buildings, caused by all the fallen debris. Over time, larger protein aggregates collect through the breakdown of other brain cells. As people age, these messes become so severe that the Lego city of brain cells in the brain can no longer function in a healthy way.",1

Up to this time, the winter had held back, and had given us a good many mild days, which were like smiles upon its wrinkled visage. The grass had kept itself green, in sheltered places, such as the nooks of southern hill-slopes, and along the lee of the stone fences.

"New medicines and other life-saving products must be made rapidly available to the people who need them, wherever they live. Most medicines are made by pharmaceutical companies in China, India, and the United States. However, regardless of where they are made, pharmaceutical companies should make sure that patients living in other countries have access to medicines. In order to do this, pharmaceutical companies need to register their products and ship them to countries where there is a need. If a medicine is not registered in a country, the product cannot be sold there. While this sounds like an easy procedure, less than one-quarter of recently launched medical products have been filed for registration in most countries that are in need of them.
The reason that many medicines are not registered is because customizing the registration to meet the strict requirements of every country can be a hard task for a company, especially since the criteria may vary from one country to another. Furthermore, the registration process can take a long time in some countries with poor healthcare systems. While registration in some countries can take a few months, in others it can take many years!",1

Lightfoot slowly shook his head. ""No,"" said he, ""I haven't torn anybody's coat.""
""Then what are those rags hanging on your antlers?"" demanded Peter.
Lightfoot chuckled. ""They are what is left of the coverings of my new antlers,"" he explained.

Why, there was a nice, little, red squirrel-girl, and she had a comb and a brush, and little looking-glass. And the glass was stuck up on a stump where the moon-beam that Uncle Wiggily was following shone on it and reflected back again. And by the light of the moon-beam the red squirrel was combing and brushing out her tail as hard as she could comb and brush it.
""What are you doing?"" asked Uncle Wiggily in surprise.
""Oh, my! How you startled me!"" exclaimed the red squirrel. ""But I'm glad it's you, Uncle Wiggily. I'm going to a surprise party soon, and I was just trying to make my tail as big as Johnnie or Billie Bushytail's, but I can't do it,"" she said sadly.
""No, and you never can,"" said the rabbit. ""Their tails are a different kind than yours, for they are gray squirrels and you are a red one. But yours is very nice. Be content to have yours as it is.""",0
"Johnny is late to meet his friends to go fishing. 
When he arrives at the beach, he realises that he's forgotten to bring his lifejacket. ""Don't worry,"" says Ben, the boat owner. ""Here's a spare one I always keep on board."" 
Because he's been fishing for years, Johnny knows the right way to put on a lifejacket. He fastens the two straps across his chest and the two straps between his legs. 
""Right!"" he says, ""it's on firmly and I'm ready to go!"" 
On the ocean, they find a good spot to fish and put down the anchor. Out of nowhere, a huge wave suddenly rises above them. ""Look! The wave's going to hit us!"" shouts one of the fishermen. 
The boat is turned upside down and the men are flung into the water. 
""Eeeeeehhh!"" they yell as they are plunged into the icy water. 
Not all of them can swim but, luckily, they are all wearing lifejackets. The men cling to the side of the upturned boat. Ben always carries a cellphone in a plastic pouch tied to his lifejacket. He calls the free emergency number 112. ""Help! We're in trouble out at sea,"" he says to the operator.",0
"Inside every cell of our bodies is a long, thin molecule called DNA. DNA is your own personal instruction manual and it tells your body everything it needs to know! DNA determines your eye color, skin tone, how tall you are, and even whether your muscles are better at sprinting or running a marathon. Just like a real instruction manual, the instructions in DNA are written in a series of letters. In DNA, there are just four lettersÛÒA, T, G, and C. These letters are combined to spell out the instruction for proteins. Proteins are the building blocks of cells. Your brain, heart, and all other organs are made of lots of different proteins. The DNA letters needed to make one protein are referred to as a ""gene."" Can you guess how many genes a human being has?

"This is a picture of the horse that refuses to run over children. His name is Prince. Once his master was driving him along a narrow street, when Prince saw an infant creeping along across the street right in his way.
Prince at once slackened his speed; and though his master, who did not know that the infant lay in the way, touched him with the whip, Prince knew better than to hurt the poor little infant.
At last the good horse stopped short, and refused to move. His master got out of the buggy to see what was the matter; and there, close by the horse's fore-feet, was a baby on its knees.
Was not Prince a good, wise horse to refuse to harm the baby? Another time, when a little boy came up behind him, when the flies were pestering him, Prince, instead of kicking him, just lifted up one of his hind-feet, and pushed him gently away.",0
"  This article treats long term average impulse control problems with runningcosts in the case that the underlying process is a L\'evy process. Under quitegeneral conditions we characterize the value of the control problem as thevalue of a stopping problem and construct an optimal strategy of the controlproblem out of an optimizer of the stopping problem if the latter exists.Assuming a maximum representation for the payoff function, we give easy toverify conditions for the control problem to have an $\left(s,S\right)$strategy as an optimizer. The occurring thresholds are given by the roots of anexplicit auxiliary function. This leads to a step by step solution techniquewhose utility we demonstrate by solving a variety of examples of impulsecontrol problems.",2
"All was now quiet in the meeting-house save the calm, steady voice of the preacher. Pretty soon a wee creature dressed all in soft brown stole across the floor of a certain pew. She was a courageous little body indeed, but what mother would not venture a good deal for her hungry babies? Such a repast as this was certainly the opportunity of a lifetime. Looking cautiously around, then concluding that all was safe, she disappeared down a hole in a corner way under the seat. In a twinkling she was back again; this time, however, she was not alone. Four little ones pattered after Mamma Mouse, and eight bright eyes spied a dinner worth running for.
Never mind what they did; but when Johnnie awoke at the strains of the closing hymn and tried to remember what had gone wrong, he saw nothing of the pink-frosted cakes save some scattered crumbs.",1
"People started coming to North America in the 1600s. Those people were called colonists. They were from all over Europe, but the most people came from England. Soon the British were the strongest influence in America. Because of this, all of the colonies became part of Great Britain. For a while people liked being part of a very large kingdom. It meant that they would be protected by a strong government. Then, In the middle of the 1700s, that changed. People started getting uncomfortable with how much power the king had.
The biggest problem people had was how much money they were paying in taxes. They sent the British a lot of money, but they didn't get to be part of the government. That meant they could not choose how their taxes were spent. Colonists started saying ""taxation without representation"" to talk about the problem. The phrase caught on, and was part of what started the American Revolution. In 1776, the colonists wrote the Declaration of Independence. The letter told the king that the colonies didn't want to be part of England anymore.",0
"When he woke up, the room looked so funny. The sun was shining into part of it, and yet all the rest was quite dark and shady. So Jack jumped up and dressed himself and went to the window. And what do you think he saw? Why, the beans his mother had thrown out of the window into the garden had sprung up into a big beanstalk which went up and up and up till it reached the sky. So the man spoke truth after all.
The beanstalk grew up quite close past Jack's window, so all he had to do was to open it and give a jump onto the beanstalk which ran up just like a big ladder. So Jack climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed till at last he reached the sky. And when he got there he found a long broad road going as straight as a dart. So he walked along, and he walked along, and he walked along till he came to a great big tall house, and on the doorstep there was a great big tall woman.",0
"There was an old lady with a stomachache. 
A fairy flew by and stopped to ask why the old lady was crying. 
""I have a terrible stomachache,"" she wept. ""Can you help me?"" 
The fairy said ""No, I can't help you. I'm Sibusiso, the evil fairy. I only do bad things."" 
""Then please, go away,"" said the woman. 
With an evil chuckle, Sibusiso disappeared. (He became invisible.) 
The old lady rubbed her stomach. Before long, another fairy came along. 
This fairy, named Khumo, also asked what was wrong. 
""My stomach is sore!"" moaned the old woman. 
Khumo responded, ""I can help! I will make some medicine for you."" 
Invisible Sibusiso was watching. 
He used his magic to send Khumo to the future. 
The old lady was surprised and looked around. 
She couldn't see anyone. She wondered what had happened to Khumo. 
The old lady started moaning again. 
A third fairy flew past and asked her what was wrong. 
""I have pain in my stomach!"" she cried. 
The old lady was losing patience with the fairies. 
Without waiting for the third fairy to reply, Sibusiso sent him to the past. 
Sibusiso started giggling. The old lady heard him.",0
"Researchers around the world are spending more and more time studying friendship. There is evidence showing that our brain responds more strongly to friends than strangers, even if the stranger has more in common with us. Spending time with friends has been shown to cause more activity in the parts of the brain that makes us feel good ÛÒ the reward circuits. What is more, having long-lasting valuable social relations, including friendships, and an active social life appears to protect the brain from illnesses later in life such as dementia, the loss of nerve cells in the brain that affects the brains of many older adults.
In summary, the contribution of brain to human social interactions is complex and not yet fully understood. What is clear now is that our brain enjoys making friends and that spending time with them can have very positive effects on learning, health, and life in general.",0
"About the middle of the afternoon we crossed a low, rocky ridge, and saw at our feet a basin, or round valley, of singular beauty. Its walls were formed by steep mountains. At its upper end lay a small lake, bordered on one side by a meadow of emerald green. The lake's other side marked the edge of the frowning pine forest which filled the rest of the valley. Beyond the lake the ground rose in a pass much frequented by game in bygone days, their trails lying along it in thick zigzags, each gradually fading out after a few hundred yards, and then starting again in a little different place, as game trails so often seem to do. We bent our steps toward these trails, and no sooner had we reached the first than the old hunter bent over it with a sharp exclamation of wonder. There in the dust, apparently but a few hours old, were the hoof-marks of a small band of bison. They were headed toward the lake. There had been half a dozen animals in the party; one a big bull, and two calves.",1
"The Norse peoples believed that their gods lived above the earth in a wonderful city named Asgard. From this city they crossed to the earth on a bridge, which by people on earth was known as the rainbow.
It seems strange that any one who might have lived with the gods in their beautiful city of Asgard and have shared in their joys and their good works should have preferred to associate with the ugly, wicked giants. But that was the case with LokiÛÓRed Loki, as he was called, because of his red hair. He was handsome like a god; he was wise and clever like a godÛÓmore clever than any of the other gods. In one way, however, he differed from the others; he had a bad heart, and liked much better to use his cleverness in getting gods and men into trouble than in making them happy. Besides this, he was very proud, and could not bear to submit even to Odin, the king of the gods.",0
"  Protein-peptide molecular docking is a difficult modeling problem. It is evenmore challenging when significant conformational changes that may occur duringthe binding process need to be predicted. In this chapter, we demonstrate thecapabilities and features of the CABS-dock server for flexible protein-peptidedocking. CABS-dock allows highly efficient modeling of full peptide flexibilityand significant flexibility of a protein receptor. During CABS-dock docking,the peptide folding and binding process is explicitly simulated and noinformation about the peptide binding site or its structure, is used. Thischapter presents a successful CABS-dock use for docking a potentiallytherapeutic peptide to a protein target. Moreover, simulation contact maps, anew CABS-dock feature, are described and applied to the docking test case.Finally, a tutorial for running CABS-dock from the command line or command linescripts is provided. The CABS-dock web server is available fromhttp://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSdock/",2

"During a drought, Yihdego left home to find a job. At that time, Tiebe was pregnant with their second child. 
After staying away for a long time, Yihdego decided to return to his home. 
Before starting his journey, he went to a wise old man for advice. 
After Yihdego greeted the old man, he said, ""I have been away from my home and family for a long time. Now I want to go back. I need your blessing and advice."" 
""Listen my son, on your journey home, do not use a shortcut. Do not comment on everything you see. Do not make a decision while you are angry,"" advised the old man. 
Yihdego set off on his journey. He met four merchants. They came to a cross- road. 
The merchants chose to go the short way. Yihdego remembered the old man's advice. He went the long way. 
The merchants who went the short way were robbed by bandits. 
After travelling the whole day, Yihdego arrived at a village. He asked many households if he could stay the night, but all refused. 
A man told him, ""We don't allow strangers to stay in our houses but ask over there.""",1
"The life of a pelican seems to be a very lazy, if not a very pleasant one. Man, ever on the watch to turn the habits of animals to his own account, observing how good a fisherman the pelican is, often catches and tames him, and makes him fish for him. I have heard of a bird of this kind in America, which was so well trained, that it would at command go off in the morning, and return at night with its pouch full, and stretched to the utmost; part of its treasure it disgorged for its master, the rest was given to the bird for its trouble. It is hardly credible what these extraordinary pouches will hold; it is said, that among other things, a man's leg with the boots on was once found in one of them.
Pelicans live in flocks; they and the cormorants sometimes help one another to get a living. The cormorant is a species of pelican, of a dusky color: it is sometimes called the sea crow.",1
"One day, when my father wished to go away to the mill, he sent my brother Robert down to the pasture to catch Billy. Robert brought the horse up to the house, tied him to the fence in the backyard, and gave him some oats in a pail.
In a pen back of the house we kept three pigs: two of them were white; and the other was spotted,ÛÓblack and white. These pigs had got out of the pen by pushing off a board from one side of it.
Soon after Billy began to eat his dinner, the two white pigs came running through the yard. They saw Billy eating his oats; and, thinking it would be nice for them to have some as well as he, they ran up to his pail, and without as much as saying, ""By your leave,"" began to help themselves.
Billy had no idea of sharing his dinner with such company as this: so he lopped back his ears, looked as cross as he possibly could, snapped at the pigs fiercely with his teeth, raised his hind-feet from the ground, as if to kick them, and at last succeeded in frightening them away.",0
"  A new extension of the sub-fractional Brownian motion, and thus of theBrownian motion, is introduced. It is a linear combination of a finite numberof sub-fractional Brownian motions, that we have chosen to call the mixedsub-fractional Brownian motion. In this paper, we study some basic propertiesof this process, its non-Markovian and non-stationarity characteristics, theconditions under which it is a semimartingale, and the main features of itssample paths. We also show that this process could serve to get a good model ofcertain phenomena, taking not only the sign (like in the case of thesub-fractional Brownian motion), but also the strength of dependence betweenthe increments of this phenomena into account.",2
"So he got into the boat, and began to rock it. The boat got loose, and drifted down the river. Walter did not notice this until he was quite a distance from the shore; then, turning round, he saw what had happened. Every moment the current was carrying him further from home.
Walter was not a timid boy, and, instead of crying, he began to reason in this way: ""The boat does not leak. It is safe and sound. There are no waves to make me afraid. The wind does not blow. Here on a seat is a thick blanket. In this box is a loaf of bread and a knife. The water of the river is good to drink, and here is a tin mug. I think I will not cry, but hope for the best.""

Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole.

"One day at the river, Dog came across some eggs in the sand. He asked himself, ""Which animal left these eggs here?"" He counted ten eggs and thought they might belong to Duck. He put them in his bag. He took the eggs home and put them in a warm place. When Dog returned to the river, he met Crocodile. She asked, ""Have you seen my eggs?"" ""I don't know anything about your eggs,"" he replied. Crocodile started visiting all the animals asking about her eggs. Meanwhile, the eggs hatched one by one. Dog did his best to look after the baby crocodiles, but there was never enough food. The young crocodiles were always hungry. One day Crocodile went to Dog's house looking for her eggs. As she stood outside, she heard the rumbling of little crocodile bellies! Crocodile stormed inside and hit Dog with her tail. Dog yelped and jumped through the window. Crocodile chased Dog all the way to the river. Dog cried, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know they were your eggs!"" Crocodile believed him and forgave him.

"A water clock, or clepsydra, is any timepiece in which time is measured by the regulated flow of liquid into (inflow type) or out from (outflow type) a vessel where the amount is then measured. Water clocks, along with sundials and hourglasses, are likely to be the oldest time-measuring instruments, with the only exceptions being the vertical gnomon and the day-counting tally stick. Where and when they were first invented is not known, and given their great antiquity it may never be. The bowl-shaped outflow is the simplest form of a water clock and is known to have existed in Babylon and in Egypt around the 16th century BC. Other regions of the world, including India and China, also have early evidence of water clocks, but the earliest dates are less certain. Some authors, however, claim that water clocks appeared in China as early as 4000 BC.",2
"Annie and her baby-brother went to ride with their papa and mamma. They crossed the river on a long bridge; and beyond it they saw horses and cows feeding on the green prairie.

Baby pointed his little chubby finger, and said, ""Ish!""
""They are prairie-dogs,"" said mamma; ""but are sometimes called the 'wish-ton-wish' and 'prairie marmot,' and sometimes 'prairie marmot squirrel.' It is like the marmot because it burrows in the ground, and like the squirrel because it has cheek-pouches.""

"Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in the Solar System and the second-smallest solid planet. Mars is rocky and cold, with polar ice caps of frozen water and carbon dioxide. It has the largest volcano in the Solar System, and some very large impact craters. Mars is named after the mythological Roman god of war because it is a red planet, the colour of blood. Mars has two small moons, called Phobos and Deimos. The planet Mars is made of rock. The ground there is red because of iron oxide (rust) in the rocks and dust. The planet's atmosphere is very thin and contains a lot of carbon dioxide and a very tiny amount of oxygen. The temperatures on Mars are colder than on Earth, because it is farther away from the Sun and has less air to keep warmth in. There is water ice and frozen carbon dioxide at the north and south poles. Mars does not have any liquid water on the surface now, but signs of run-off on the surface were probably caused by water.",0
"  The largely intrinsically disordered phenylalanine-glycine-rich nucleoporins(FG Nups) underline a selectivity mechanism, which enables the rapidtranslocation of transport factors (TFs) through the nuclear pore complexes(NPCs). Conflicting models of NPC transport have assumed that FG Nups undergodifferent conformational transitions upon interacting with TFs. To selectivelycharacterize conformational changes in FG Nups induced by TFs we performedsmall-angle neutron scattering (SANS) with contrast matching. Conformationalensembles derived SANS data indicate an increase in the overall size of FG Nupsis associated with TF interaction. Moreover, the organization of the FG motifin the interacting state is consistent with prior experimental analysesdefining that FG motifs undergo conformational restriction upon interactingwith TFs. These results provide structural insights into a highly dynamicinteraction and illustrate how functional disorder imparts rapid and selectiveFG Nup / TF interactions.",2
"To understand how each sensory input contributes to the experience of self-motion, it is helpful to remove individual sensory inputs to see what happens. For example, how does removing vision, using a blindfold for example, affect our ability to judge the distance we have traveled, our movement speed, or our movement direction? It turns out that we can actually still perform pretty well when one sense is missing! But if we want to know how each sensory input contributes when all inputs are available, as is the case during most everyday interactions, it becomes difficult to manipulate each input independently. Modern virtual reality (VR) technologies have made this challenge easier (to the experience of self-motion). Using VR, the authors studied the contributions of visual and vestibular information for judging heading direction, which means knowing which way you are going. Participants were seated on a moving platform that moved them forward to the left or forward to the right, at very precise angles. Participants also watched a projection screen that made it look like they were in space, flying through a cloud of stars. The task for participants was simply to judge whether they moved to the left or to the right.",2
"But the question, Why are we at war? can be answered fairly well by anybody conversant with the facts of the European situation.
We are not at war because the Emperor, as war lord, has sent out word to his legions to begin a war of world-wide aggression, carrying into its vortex intellectual Germany, notwithstanding all her peaceful aspirations.
I may fairly claim to be a representative of that intellectual Germany which comes in now for a good deal of sympathy, but I must own that intellectual Germany, as far as I know about her, thoroughly approves of the Emperor's present policy.
She approves of it not on the principle merely ""Right or wrong, my country""; she does so because she knows that war has become inevitable, and that we must face that ordeal when we are ready for it, not at the moment most agreeable to our enemies.",2
"After breakfast she would go into the field where the hay was making, and help with her own little rake to toss and spread it. But at eleven o'clock her mother would call her in, put on her cool night-dress, and lay her in her crib for a nap, and by that time the little girl was usually tired enough to be glad to go to sleep.
But one day she was having such a nice time with some little cousins who had come to play with her, that, when her mother called her in for her nap, she said, ""Oh, please, mamma, don't make me go to sleep today; I'm not a bit sleepy. See how wide open my eyes are!""

"So the Bear had a mind to learn to fish too, and bade the Fox tell him how he was to set about it.
""Oh! It's an easy craft for you"", answered the Fox, ""and soon learned. You've only got to go upon the ice, and cut a hole and stick your tail down into it; and so you must go on holding it there as long as you can. You're not to mind if your tail smarts a little; that's when the fish bite. The longer you hold it there the more fish you'll get; and then all at once out with it, with a cross pull sideways, and with a strong pull too.""
Yes; the Bear did as the Fox had said, and held his tail a long, long the down in the hole, till it was fast frozen in. Then he pulled it out with a cross pull, and it snapped short off. That's why Bruin goes about with a stumpy tail this very day.",0
"For an easy and striking lecture experiment, I employ a tube open at both ends and bent like a W. The two open arms are short and the platinum wires are fixed at the highest bend. The tube is filled with hot mercury--one of the ends being closed by a caoutchouc stopper for the purpose--and a dry mixture of 5 volumes of air and 2 volumes of carbonic oxide is introduced into the bent tube over the mercury. A little phosphoric oxide is passed up one arm. After a few minutes the gases may be submitted to the spark without exploding. A little water may then be introduced through a pipette into the other arm; and if the spark is passed directly the gases ignite in the wet and not in the dry arm of the tube. The admixture of the inert nitrogen renders a larger quantity of aqueous vapor necessary for the explosion than when only carbonic oxide and oxygen in proper proportion are present.",2

Papa looked up from his paper to see what amused his little girl so much; and, when she had told him, he said he would have a pair of spectacles ready for her; and mamma said she would make her a cap; and Hettie said her little arm-chair would be very nice for a grandmother's chair.",0

He took off the new clothes and put his old ones back on. Next he saw the root. It was withered from the sun. He asked himself what the old woman thought he would do with the root. Next to the root, there was a bowl of food. The food smelled delicious and the boy was hungry. He couldn't stop himself from eating. When he had finished, he remembered what the old woman had told him. The old woman had said he must only take the root. He looked around for the root, but he couldn't see it anymore. The boy left the forest feeling disappointed. He went back to tell the old woman what had happened. But the old woman was gone.",0
"One day Freddie got his papa to build him a small shelf on the tree, about four feet from the ground, so that he could put nuts on it to feed the squirrels. At first the little fellows were very shy, and would not come near the shelf, but sat on the branches of the tree; and we fancied that we heard them saying to each other, ""Do you think that little boy would hurt us, if we should run down, and take one of those nuts?""
But, after a while, they came down, one by one, took the nuts, and went scampering up to the top branches; and in a few minutes down came the empty shells. They grew so tame before the summer was over, that if we put any thing on their shelf, and took a seat a few steps away, they would come down quite boldly, and get their breakfast.",0

Once he shook both hands furiously in the air, and twice he sprang from his seat and hurried down the road. When he rose, however, Alleyne observed that his robe was much too long and loose for him in every direction, trailing upon the ground and bagging about his ankles, so that even with trussed-up skirts he could make little progress. He ran once, but the long gown clogged him so that he slowed down into a shambling walk, and finally plumped into the heather once more.",2
"Helen Adams Keller was born on 27th June 1880, in Tuscumbia, Alabama, United States. Her family lived on an estate called Ivy Greens, built by Helen's grandfather. Her father, Arthur Keller, spent many years as an editor for the Tuscumbia North Alabamian newspaper, and had served as a captain in the Army. Her mother, Kate Adams, was the daughter of a confederate general. Helen was born with the ability to see and hear. At 19 months old, she became ill, and this illness left Helen both deaf and blind.
As she grew up, she found a way of communicating with the daughter of the family's cook; Martha Washington. They invented a kind of sign language and by the time Helen was 7 years old they had created more than 60 different signs for use in their personal communication.
Around this time, Helen became very frustrated and diffcult to control. She had violent temper tantrums and would giggle uncontrollably when she was happy. Her family was worried about Helen and went in search of help. Unaware of how to deal with Helen's disabilities, the family had indulged , which at this point it was to her detriment.",0
"All the information about a microbe, or any kind of cell, exists in the cell's DNA. DNA is the molecule that contains the genetic code of organisms and, thus, can be described as the ""blueprint"" of the cell, since it tells the cell what to do and when to do it. In can further be divided in small subsections called genes. There are thousands of genes in the DNA of an organism and each gene has a specific function. For example, the human DNA contains about 25,000ÛÒ35,000 genes, but only a very few genes are responsible for the color of your eyes. The NGS technology allows scientists to ""read"" the DNA from a whole microbial community without the need for pure cultures of the microbes. This approach is called ""Metagenome sequencing"" and it provides the scientist with a list of the genes of all the microbes living in a particular area.",1
"We went from the path through the forest: a whole flock of bare-headed boys surrounded us. They would all be our guides; the one screamed longer than the other, and every one gave his contradictory explanation, how high the water stood, and how high it did not stand, or could stand. There was also a great difference of opinion amongst the learned.
We soon stopped on a ling-covered rock, a dizzying terrace. Before us, but far below, was the roaring water, the Hell Fall, and over this again, fall after fall, the rich, rapid, rushing elv--the outlet of the largest lake in Sweden. What a sight! what a foaming and roaring, above--below! It is like the waves of the sea, but of effervescing champagne--of boiling milk. The water rushes round two rocky islands at the top so that the spray rises like meadow dew. Below, the water is more compressed, then hurries down again, shoots forward and returns in circles like smooth water, and then rolls darting its long sea-like fall into the Hell Fall. What a tempest rages in the deep--what a sight! Words cannot express it!",2
"All this I knew in England, but knew it from the reports of others. I did not, could not, know what the destitution, the desolation of Belgium was, what were the imperative needs of this people, until I got to Holland and to the borders of Belgian territory. Inside that territory I could not pass because I was a Britisher, but there I could see German soldiers, the Landwehr, keeping guard over what they call their new German province. Belgium a German province!
There at Maastricht I saw fugitives crossing the frontier into Holland with all their worldly goods on their shoulders or in their hands, or with nothing at all, seeking hospitality of a little land which itself feels, though it is neutral, the painful stress and cost of the war. There, on the frontier, I was standing between Dutch soldiers and German soldiers, so near the Germans that I could almost have touched them, so near three German officers that their conversation as they saluted me reached my ears.",2
"""The General's Double,"" by Captain King, and ""Trooper Ross and Signal Butte,"" by the same author, come to us from the press of J. B. Lippincott Company. The former is a capital story of the Civil War, the plot being based upon the remarkable likeness existing between two men in the Union army. It has all of the charm of the works of this favorite author.
The second book contains two stories, the heroes of both being boys. The first, ""Trooper Ross,"" describes the adventures of an officer's son, his exciting experiences with native americans on the plains as a little chap, taking his part at boarding-school later; then, failing to obtain his admission to West Point, he works his way through the ranks to his commission. ""Signal Butte"" covers a series of exciting adventures in Arizona, in which two boys are the central figures.",2
"Leopard was always trying to catch Antelope. And Antelope was always escaping from Leopard. One day, Leopard called out to Antelope, ""Let's be friends. What you eat, I don't eat. Nothing makes us enemies."" Antelope agreed. So Leopard said, ""Let's make an oath to be friends. If either of us breaks the oath, her child will die."" They made an oath to be friends. At night, Antelope slept under a tree. Leopard slept in the branches above. Antelope soon became fat. Leopard became thin. Leopard was tempted to eat fat Antelope. She said to herself, ""I don't care about the oath. I don't even have a child!"" Leopard jumped down to catch Antelope. But she got caught between two branches. Antelope was shocked. She leaped up and cried, ""Beh! Beh!"" Leopard begged, ""My friend, help me. We agreed that whoever broke our oath to be friends, would lose a child."" Antelope replied, ""It must have been your parent who made the oath. Now it is meant for you!""",0
"It is a hot Saturday morning on the farm. Maya, Duksie and Doobie are helping Mama K in her vegetable garden. The children work all morning. They dig compost into the soil. They weed and water the garden. Then, they harvest what is ripe. 
Today each of the children will take home freshly picked strawberries, spinach and carrots. 
Mama K always gives the children a treat for helping her. Sometimes the treat is cake, chocolate, or long sweets that look like snakes. Sometimes it's apples, pears, or oranges. 
Mama K has only one rule. ""Share it fair!"" The children know they must share the treats equally, so they all get the same amount. 
Today Mama K has baked a round strawberry cake with pink icing and berries from her garden. The children wait on the grass for their treat. ""Here you go!"" smiles Mama K. ""But remember the rule that everyone must get the same. Share it fair! Don't fight!"" 
Maya has the first turn to share the cake. She uses the knife to trace lines in the icing. The others watch her. She does not cut the cake yet. The others must first agree if her way is fair.",0
"Just as the front of the car approached, Frank Merriwell received a push from behind that sent him flat upon the track directly in front of the car wheels!
That particular car did not have a fender, and it seemed that Frank must be mangled beneath the wheels. The motorman saw the lad go down and put on the brake hard, but he could not stop the car in time.
Frank realized that he had been pushed upon the track by someone whose deliberate purpose it was to maim or murder him, but he could not save himself. He struck the paving, and the iron wheels seemed right upon him.
But Jack Diamond moved with marvelous quickness. He made a grasp at Frank as the latter fell, almost caught him, then stooped, grasped his coat and yanked Merry from the track.",0
"Archaeology is the study of the past by looking for the remains and artifacts (historical things) left by the people who lived long ago. These remains can include old coins, tools, buildings, and inscriptions. Archaeologists, the people who study archaeology, use these remains to understand how people lived.
Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the past to know where they come from.
When archaeologists do fieldwork, they look for remains, often by digging deep in the ground. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist's base is, maybe a university or museum. They record everything they found by writing down on paper or entering the information into a computer, so that they can build a picture of everything that is found. As settlements (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings. Ancient Rome, for example, is now up to 40 feet (12 meters) below the present city. This is why archaeological fieldwork is expensive and why it takes a long time.",0
"The American horses, in time, met the wild horses, and then men noticed that they were very different animals. The wild horse is smaller and more muscular, he has stronger and stouter limbs, a larger head, and a more bushy mane and tail. His ears are longer and more inclined to lie back on his head, his feet are smaller and more pointed in front, and his hair is rougher and thicker. His color is often curiously mixed in black and white dots and flecks, like some circus horses that you may have seen; and, if his color is uniform, it is generally dark red or deep gray or mouse color. These mustangs are quite wild, and have no fixed feeding-ground. They scamper in droves over the rolling prairies and pampas, and sleep at night in such dry places as they can find. They keep in companies for protection against bears or other wild animals, and if they are attacked, they put their noses together and form a circle with their heels out, as if they had been told of the old Spanish fighting days, and of the soldiers forming with their pikes solid squares to resist attacks of cavalry.",1
"Every log in my house is as straight as a pine can grow. Each room has a window and a door on the east side, and the south room has two windows on the south with space between for my heater, which is one of those with a grate front so I can see the fire burn. It is almost as good as a fireplace. The logs are unhewed outside because I like the rough finish, but inside the walls are perfectly square and smooth. The cracks in the walls are snugly filled with ""daubing"" and then the walls are covered with heavy gray building-paper, which makes the room very warm, and I really like the appearance. I had two rolls of wallpaper with a bold rose pattern. By being very careful I was able to cut out enough of the roses, which are divided in their choice of color as to whether they should be red, yellow, or pink, to make a border about eighteen inches from the ceiling. They brighten up the wall and the gray paper is fine to hang pictures upon. Those you have sent us make our room very attractive.",1
"Ancient Egyptians used pictures to make a phonetic alphabet as in a rebus, so that each sound could be written with a picture-word, a phonogram or pictograph. For example, a zig-zag for water came to mean the letter ""n"", because the Egyptian word for water started with n. This same picture became our letter 'M' in the Latin alphabet, because the Semitic word for water started with m, and Semitic workers changed the symbols to fit sounds in their own language. In the same way, our Latin letter 'N' came from the hieroglyph for snake as the word for ""snake"" started with n in Semitic. In Egyptian, this picture had stood for a sound like English ""J"" because of their word for snake. Some pictures came to represent ideas, and these are known as ideograms.
The Egyptians used between 700 or 800 pictures, or glyphs. They were written from right to left and from top to bottom. They did not use punctuation.",1
"  If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables with distributions $\mu$ and$\nu$ then $U=\psi(X,Y)$ and $V=\phi(X,Y)$ are also independent for some $\psi$and $\phi$. Properties of this type are known for many important probabilitydistributions $\mu$ and $\nu$. Also related characterization questions havebeen widely investigated: Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent and let $U$ and $V$ beindependent. Are the distributions of $X$ and $Y$ $\mu$ and $\nu$,respectively? Recently two new properties and characterizations of this kindinvolving the Kummer distribution appeared in the literature. For independent$X$ and $Y$ with gamma and Kummer distributions Koudou and Vallois observedthat $U=(1+(X+Y)^{-1})/(1+X^{-1})$ and $V=X+Y$ are also independent, and Hamzaand Vallois observed that $U=Y/(1+X)$ and $V=X(1+Y/(1+X))$ are independent. In2011 and 2012 Koudou, Vallois characterizations related to the first propertywere proved, while the characterizations in the second setting have beenrecently given in Piliszek, Weso{\l}owski (2016). In both cases technicalassumptions on smoothness properties of densities of $X$ and $Y$ were needed.In 2015, the assumption of independence of $U$ and $V$ in the first setting wasweakened to constancy of regressions of $U$ and $U^{-1}$ given $V$ with nodensity assumptions. However, the additional assumption $\mathbb{E}X^{-1}<\infty$ was introduced. In the present paper we provide a completeanswer to the characterization question in both settings without any additionaltechnical assumptions regarding smoothness or existence of moments. Theapproach is, first, via characterizations exploiting some conditions imposed onregressions of $U$ given $V$, which are weaker than independence, but for whichmoment assumptions are necessary. Second, using a technique of change ofmeasure we show that the moment assumptions can be avoided.",2
"I am very fond of babies. One reason of it, I think, is, that they cannot hurt me with their little hands. They pull my ears, but not so hard as to give me pain.
Once, on a hot day, when my mouth was open, and my tongue was out, Dot took hold of my tongue, and pulled it as hard as he could. I did not even say Bow-wow. I let him pull away.
I would have all people know that this baby is not to be touched while I am here. If you come near to disturb baby, I shall bark; but, if you try to touch him, I shall bite. So be careful. You must not even touch baby's rattle that lies on the floor.

"In places where the temperature changes across seasons, winter is the coldest part of the year. During winter, many animals greatly reduce their activity, often finding burrows or other retreats to stay in until spring. However, these retreats are not usually the same retreats in which they were born or hatched.
One exception is turtles. Some adult turtles wait out the cold of winter under water in ponds or lakes that may freeze over. Overwintering under water can be a problem for young turtles, because it is hard for them to deal with the very low levels of oxygen (water is <1% oxygen, while air is ~21% oxygen). So, if overwintering underwater would not work, where can hatchlings safely spend the winter? In burrows, underground. But there is one more problem. Turtle embryos are not very resistant to freezing. If it gets too cold, embryos still within eggs could die, while hatchlings have a better chance of surviving. For the best chance of survival, some baby turtles hatch from their eggs (so they would not freeze) and wait in their nests (to get enough oxygen) until spring, when the weather warms and they emerge .",1
"  Arbitrary public announcement logic (APAL) reasons about how the knowledge ofa set of agents changes after true public announcements and after arbitraryannouncements of true epistemic formulas. We consider a variant of arbitrarypublic announcement logic called positive arbitrary public announcement logic(APAL+), which restricts arbitrary public announcements to announcement ofpositive formulas. Positive formulas prohibit statements about the ignorance ofagents. The positive formulas correspond to the universal fragment infirst-order logic. As two successive announcements of positive formulas neednot correspond to the announcement of a positive formula, APAL+ is ratherdifferent from APAL. We show that APAL+ is more expressive than publicannouncement logic PAL, and that APAL+ is incomparable with APAL. We alsoprovide a sound and complete infinitary axiomatisation.",2

Round Top and High Peak, two of the highest summits, are about thirty-eight hundred feet above the level of the sea. They are well covered with forests, and in autumn, when the leaves begin to change, they make a very brilliant show.
The Catskill-Mountain House is finely situated on a rocky terrace, twenty-two hundred feet above the river. It is twelve miles from the village of Catskill, and is much resorted to in the summer season.

"The sky too has its changes, but they are less marked than those of the vegetation and the river. Clouds map it up at times, but it is normally a dome of blending tints, and the main tint blue.

But the core of blue persists, and so it is by night. Then the stars hang like lamps from the immense vault.

"  The accuracy of deep neural networks is degraded when the distribution offeatures in the test environment (target domain) differs from that of thetraining (source) environment. To mitigate the degradation, test-timeadaptation (TTA), where a model adapts to the target domain without access tothe source dataset, can be used in the test environment. However, the existingTTA methods lack feature distribution alignment between the source and targetdomains, which unsupervised domain adaptation mainly addresses, becauseaccessing the source dataset is prohibited in the TTA setting. In this paper,we propose a novel TTA method, named Covariance-Aware Feature alignment (CAFe),which explicitly aligns the source and target feature distributions at testtime. To perform alignment without accessing the source data, CAFe usesauxiliary feature statistics (mean and covariance) pre-computed on the sourcedomain, which are lightweight and easily prepared. Further, to improveefficiency and stability, we propose feature grouping, which splits the featuredimensions into groups according to their correlations by using spectralclustering to avoid degeneration of the covariance matrix. We empirically showthat CAFe outperforms prior TTA methods on a variety of distribution shifts.",2

"When it was found that the Griffin showed no sign of going away, all the people who were able to do so left the town. The canons and the higher officers of the church had fled away during the first day of the Griffin's visit, leaving behind only the Minor Canon and some of the men who opened the doors and swept the church. All the citizens who could afford it shut up their houses and traveled to distant parts, and only the working people and the poor were left behind. After some days these ventured to go about and attend to their business, for if they did not work they would starve. They were getting a little used to seeing the Griffin; and having been told that he did not eat between equinoxes, they did not feel so much afraid of him as before.

"Reaction time, and more specifically delayed reaction, is widely cited as a key contributor to vehicular accidents. Reaction time in relation to the ERB is defined as the time it takes for a motorist to react to an external hazard or stimuli and then carry out the appropriate reaction, or evasive maneuver such as braking when a vehicle in front stops. The feedback offered by an HUD is projected onto the windshield of a vehicle with the aim of integrating outside stimuli and the instrumental feedback; thus removing the need to remove a driver's eyes from the road. Studies of reaction time to hazards in HUD vs HDD designs have found that the average reaction times for HUD are faster. This trend appears to continue across demographics, including both categories of experience level and age.
Speed maintenance is the extent to which a driver maintains a speed and adjusts their speed to suit traffic laws and environmental conditions. The use of HUDs appears to produce better speed maintenance in drivers under experimental conditions when compared to HDDs.",2

"Memory is a very large topic, and researchers divide the topic of memory to make it easier to study. There is long-term memory, short-term memory, and working memory. Long-term memory allows you to remember information for some timeÛÓfor a few minutes, or for your whole life. For example, if you are divided into groups and are given a number, you will remember your group number for the entire activity. Or, you will remember your name for a lifetime. Short-term memory stores immediate information and is erased in less than a minute. For example, if someone tells you a phone number and you dial it immediately and then forget it. It is more difficult to dial a phone number if a person tells you the whole phone number at once, as opposed to telling you the number in bits and pieces. When you work with short-term memory, it is called working memory. For example, when you read a sentence, you need to remember the first words in the sentence until you finish reading the end of the sentence. Or else, the sentence will not make any sense!
Some researchers divide short-term memory into verbal memory and visuospatial memory .",1
"Metabolism is the set of life-sustaining chemical transformations within the cells of living organisms. The three main purposes of metabolism are the conversion of food/fuel to energy to run cellular processes, the conversion of food/fuel to building blocks for proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some carbohydrates, and the elimination of nitrogenous wastes. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word metabolism can also refer to the sum of all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, including digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells, in which case the set of reactions within the cells is called intermediary metabolism or intermediate metabolism.
Metabolism is usually divided into two categories: catabolism, the breaking down of organic matter, for example, by cellular respiration, and anabolism, the building up of components of cells such as proteins and nucleic acids. Usually, breaking down releases energy and building up consumes energy.",2
"But why she liked him she could not explain satisfactorily to herself when she partly attempted to do so. She could discover in him none of those brilliant and promising traits which Gaston, her husband, had often assured her that he possessed. On the contrary, he sat rather mute and receptive before her chatty eagerness to make him feel at home and in the face of Gaston's frank and wordy hospitality. His manner was as courteous toward her as the most exacting woman could require; but he made no direct appeal to her approval or even esteem.
Once settled at the plantation he seemed to like to sit upon the wide portico in the shade of one of the big Corinthian pillars, smoking his cigar lazily and listening attentively to Gaston's experience as a sugar planter.
""This is what I call living,"" he would utter with deep satisfaction, as the air that swept across the sugar field caressed him with its warm and scented velvety touch. It pleased him also to get on familiar terms with the big dogs that came about him, rubbing themselves sociably against his legs.",2
"Nobody but Americans could govern America. The people were too intelligent, too active, too various-minded, too full of native quality and genius to be ruled from abroad. If they were to fall under foreign subjection, they would become a dead weight in the world, instead of a source of life; as Adams said, every increase in population would be but an increase of slaves. And that they preferred death to slavery was every day becoming increasingly manifest. They felt that the future was in them, and that they must have space and freedom to bring it forth; and it is one of the paradoxes of history that England, to whom they stood in blood-relationship, from whom they derived the instinct for liberty, should have attempted to reduce them to the most absolute bondage anywhere known, except in the colonies of Spain. She was actuated partly by the pride of authority, centered in George III, and from him percolating into his creatures in the ministry and Parliament; and partly by the horde of office-seekers and holders whose aim was sheer pecuniary gain at any cost of honor and principle.",2
"The physical reasons for elastic behavior can be quite different for different materials. In metals, the atomic lattice changes size and shape when forces are applied (energy is added to the system). When forces are removed, the lattice goes back to the original lower energy state. For rubbers and other polymers, elasticity is caused by the stretching of polymer chains when forces are applied.
Hooke's law states that the force required to deform elastic objects should be directly proportional to the distance of deformation, regardless of how large that distance becomes. This is known as perfect elasticity, in which a given object will return to its original shape no matter how strongly it is deformed. This is an ideal concept only; most materials which possess elasticity in practice remain purely elastic only up to very small deformations, after which plastic (permanent) deformation occurs.",2
"Suddenly, as Theresa sat there, her head, filled with its tender thoughts of me, held in her gentle hands, I felt Allan's step on the carpeted stair outside. Theresa felt it, too,ÛÓbut how? for it was not audible. She gave a start, swept the black envelopes out of sight, and pretended to be writing in a little book. Then I forgot to watch her any longer in my absorption in Allan's coming. It was he, of course, that I was awaiting. It was for him that I had made this first lonely, frightened effort to return, to recover.... It was not that I had supposed he would allow himself to recognize my presence, for I had long been sufficiently familiar with his hard and fast denials of the invisible. He was so reasonable always, so saneÛÓso blindfolded. But I had hoped that because of his very rejection of the ether that now contained me I could perhaps all the more safely, the more secretly, watch him, linger near him. He was near now, very near,ÛÓbut why did Theresa, sitting there in the room that had never belonged to her, appropriate for herself his coming?",2
"Following the First Punic War, Rome set about the task of unifying Italy under Roman rule. They subdued the Gauls and, through the Ebro Treaty with Hasdrubal the Fair, secured the boundary between Rome and Carthage's empires in Spain at the Ebro River. Rome would control all territories north of the river and Carthage those territories to the south. The Gauls saw the Romans as conquerors and occupiers and so, when Hannibal began his operations in the Iberian Peninsula, they did little to stop him. He not only had the support of the people but, equally important if not more so, the devotion of his army. Only 28-years-old upon assuming command, Hannibal had spent most of his life in army camps on campaign. The historian Durant, quoting Livy, writes, ""He was the first to enter the battle and the last to abandon the field."" Hannibal's army knew they could depend on him to take care of them just as surely as they knew the punishments he would wreak upon them if they disappointed him. In this same way, the people of the region looked to Hannibal to relieve them of the Romans.",2
"The instrument consists of two permanent horseshoe magnets, fixed parallel with each other and an inch apart. A very thin spool or bobbin of insulated wire is suspended, like the pendulum of a clock, between these permanent magnets, in such a manner that the bobbin hangs just in front of the four poles. A counterpoise is fixed at the top of the pendulum bar, which permits the adjusting of the antagonistic forces represented by the action of the swinging bobbin, and two springs, which are insulated from the mass, and which form one electrode of the local or annunciator circuit, while the pendulum bar forms the other.
It will be easily understood that as the bobbin hangs freely in the center of a very strong magnetic field (formed by the four poles of the two permanent magnets), the slightest current sent through the bobbin will cause the bobbin to be attracted from one direction, while it will be repelled from the other, according to the polarity of the current transmitted.",2
"Lincoln died a martyr to the cause to which he had given his life, and both life and death were heroic. The qualities which enabled him to do his great work are very clear now to all men. His courage and his wisdom, his keen perception and his almost prophetic foresight, enabled him to deal with all the problems of that distracted time as they arose around him. But he had some qualities, apart from those of the intellect, which were of equal importance to his people and to the work he had to do. His character, at once strong and gentle, gave confidence to everyone, and dignity to his cause. He had an infinite patience, and a humor that enabled him to turn aside many difficulties which could have been met in no other way. But most important of all was the fact that he personified a great sentiment, which ennobled and uplifted his people, and made them capable of the patriotism which fought the war and saved the Union.",1
"Early one bright morning, three little girls who were spending the summer on their uncle's farm went out to gather wild flowers in the woods not far from the house. Just as they came to the edge of the wood, they heard the faint bleating of a lamb.
They listened, keeping very still, but could not make out where the sound came from. Then Mary, the eldest of the three, said, ""Let us each go a different way, and hunt till we find the poor little thing.""
They did so; and in a few minutes, Lulu the youngest called to the others, ""I've found it! I've found it! Come, Mollie and Bessie, come quick and help me; for the dear little lamb is hurt, and I'm afraid it will die.""
You may be sure that they all ran quickly, and it was well that they did; for the lamb had broken its leg, and could not have lived much longer if some one had not taken care of it. They found Lulu trying to help the poor creature; but she could do little except to soothe it.",0
"The parties in Switzerland are fortunately not divided by questions of race or religion, but the pasteur owned that the Catholics were a difficult element, and had to be carefully managed. They include the whole population of the Italian cantons, and part of the French and German. In Geneva and other large towns the labor question troublesomely enters, and the radicals, like our Democrats, are sometimes the retrograde party.
The pasteur spoke with smiling slight of the PÌ¬re Hyacinthe and the DÌ¦llinger movements, and he confessed that the Protestants were cut up into too many sects to make progress among the Catholic populations. The Catholics often keep their children out of the public schools, as they do with us, but these have to undergo the State examinations, to which all the children, whether taught at home or in private schools, must submit. He deplored the want of moral instruction in the public schools, but he laughed at the attempts in France to instil non-religious moral principles: when I afterwards saw this done in the Florentine ragged schools I could not feel that he was altogether right.",2
"Dodger is a full-blooded Scotch terrier. His eyes are the brightest of all bright eyes; and he acts just as one might suppose from his name. He dodges here and there,ÛÓunder the sofa, and behind the stove, and up in a chair, and sometimes puts his paws up on the baby's cradle.
The other day, the baby's red sock dropped off from his foot; and Dodger slyly picked it up, and, going to a corner of the room, ate off the red tassels that were on it. I don't think he will do it again; for he did not act as though they tasted very good.
Dodger has many cunning ways. He will bring his master's slippers, sit up straight, pretend to be dead, and do many other funny things. Just now his master is trying to teach him to shut a door.",0
"Perhaps he did not see the lark for a long time, but he would have heard him, far out of sight in the endless sky, thrilling and thrilling until the world seemed to have no other sound but that clear sweetness; and what a world it was to make that sound! Whistles and chirps, coos and caws and croaks, would have grown familiar to him. And he could at last have told which brother of the great brotherhood was making the noise he heard at any moment. The wind too: he would have listened to its thousand voices as it moved in all seasons and in all moods. Perhaps a horse would stray into the thick screen about his home, and would look as solemnly on Fionn as Fionn did on it. Or, coming suddenly on him, the horse might stare, all a-cock with eyes and ears and nose, one long-drawn facial extension, ere he turned and bounded away with manes all over him and hoofs all under him and tails all round him.",2
"Sophie was the daughter of a well-to-do worker in wood near Amsterdam. She was his only daughter, and although he had nothing to say against the English sailor who had won her heart, and who was chief owner of the ship he commanded, he grieved much that she should leave her native land; and he and her three brothers determined that she should always bear her former home in her recollection. They therefore prepared as her wedding gift a facsimile of the home in which she had been born and bred. The furniture and framework were similar in every particular, and it needed only the insertion of the brickwork and plaster when it arrived. Two of her brothers made the voyage in the Good Venture, and themselves put the framework, beams, and flooring together, and saw to the completion of the house on the strip of ground that William Martin had purchased on the bank of the river.",1
"The Rosetta Stone is a stone with writing carved into it. French soldiers found it in Egypt in 1799. It helped people get a better understanding of the Ancient Egyptian writing system called hieroglyphics. Its discovery led to the translation of Ancient Egyptian writing. The stone is named after the city where it was found, Rosetta. Today, that city is called ""Rashid"". The stone is now in the British Museum in London.
It had three pieces of writing on it that said the same thing in three different languages. One was in an Ancient Egyptian script called demotic, the local language of the people in Egypt at that time. The other two languages were hieroglyphics and Ancient Greek.
The historians could already read the Greek. Using this knowledge they were able to work out how to read the Egyptian scripts.",0
"Hamilton was working hard to bring New York over to an understanding that she must stand firm against English rule. He organized meetings, gave addresses, wrote letters, newspaper articles and pamphlets. Then he joined a military company and was perfecting himself in the science of war.
There were frequent outbreaks between Tory mobs and Whigs, and the breaking up of your opponents' meeting was looked upon as a pleasant pastime.
Then came the British ship ""Asia"" and opened fire on the town. This no doubt made Whigs of a good many Tories. Whig sentiment was on the increase; gangs of men marched through the streets and the king's stores were broken into, and prominent Royalists found their houses being threatened.
Doctor Cooper, President of King's College, had been very pronounced in his rebukes to Congress and the Colonies, and a mob made its way to his house. Arriving there, Hamilton and his chum Troup were found on the steps, determined to protect the place. Hamilton stepped forward, and in a strong speech urged that Doctor Cooper had merely expressed his own private views, which he had a right to do, and the house must not on any account be molested.",2
"  A key feature of human intelligence is the ability to generalize beyond thetraining distribution, for instance, parsing longer sentences than seen in thepast. Currently, deep neural networks struggle to generalize robustly to suchshifts in the data distribution. We study robust generalization in the contextof using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn regular languages. Wehypothesize that standard end-to-end modeling strategies cannot generalize wellto systematic distribution shifts and propose a compositional strategy toaddress this. We compare an end-to-end strategy that maps strings to labelswith a compositional strategy that predicts the structure of the deterministicfinite-state automaton (DFA) that accepts the regular language. Wetheoretically prove that the compositional strategy generalizes significantlybetter than the end-to-end strategy. In our experiments, we implement thecompositional strategy via an auxiliary task where the goal is to predict theintermediate states visited by the DFA when parsing a string. Our empiricalresults support our hypothesis, showing that auxiliary tasks can enable robustgeneralization. Interestingly, the end-to-end RNN generalizes significantlybetter than the theoretical lower bound, suggesting that it is able to achieveat least some degree of robust generalization.",2
"An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun. Starting in 1988, and as of 16 August 2016, there have been 3,501 exoplanets in 2,623 planetary systems and 592 multiple planetary systems confirmed. HARPS (since 2004) has discovered about a hundred exoplanets while the Kepler space telescope (since 2009) has found more than two thousand. Kepler has also detected a few thousand candidate planets, of which about 11% may be false positives. On average, there is at least one planet per star, with a percentage having multiple planets. About 1 in 5 Sun-like stars have an ""Earth-sized"" planet in the habitable zone, with the nearest expected to be within 12 light-years distance from Earth. Assuming 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, that would be 11 billion potentially habitable Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way, rising to 40 billion if planets orbiting the numerous red dwarfs are included.",2
"The usual dimensions of a cabin were sixteen by twenty feet. The timber for the building, having been already cut, lay at handÛÓlogs of hickory, oak, young pine, walnut, or persimmon. To make the foundations, the men seized four of the thickest logs, laid them in place, and notched and grooved and hammered them into as close a clinch as if they had grown so. The wood must grip by its own substance alone to hold up the pioneer's dwelling, for there was not an iron nail to be had in the whole of the Back Country. Logs laid upon the foundation logs and notched into each other at the four corners formed the walls; and, when these stood at seven feet, the builders laid parallel timbers and puncheons to make both flooring and ceiling. The ridgepole of the roof was supported by two crotched trees and the roofing was made of logs and wooden slabs. The crevices of the walls were packed close with red clay and moss. Lastly, spaces for a door and windows were cut out.",1
"If such is the case, what more important work can there be for the father than to read with his son, to watch these beginnings of education which mean so much more than the mere instruction in school, and to be a power in developing that right method of reading which means not only the acquisition of knowledge but also the acquirement of power and the making of character. The busy man is tired at night and inclined to think that he has no time to give to reading with his boys. He may think, too, that reading childish stories is beneath his dignity. Such is not the case. There is a great abundance of literature that is manly, and at the same time interesting to a boy. If the father feels that he is past the time when he has any sympathy with the fairy stories and the little poems that the infants like, if he thinks the nursery rhymes are silly and the fables too old to be true, that is because he has not recently read them.",1

At the grazing banks Ekai would hold one of the goats after it has taken water confirming how the goats are growing fat each and every day. Ekai has a dog pet called Bony. Every time Ekai is around he would give Bony food and a hot shower with a shampoo, that makes Bony a happy and healthy dog.

Sleeping? What a bore. Anu began to sulk. Aai pulled Anu close. ""The baby is still very small, Anu. You must not trouble her. After all, you are her big sister!"" 
Big sister! Anu felt very important. But why did the baby have to go to sleep? Just then they heard a thin wail...

"The child's mind has the receptive side, the sensibility, the most prominent. His senses are alert. He handles and examines objects about him. He sees more, and he learns more from the seeing, than he will in later years unless his perceptive powers are definitely trained and observation made a habit. His judgment and his will are weak. He reasons imperfectly. He chooses without appropriate motives. He needs the building up and development given by educational training. Nature points out the method.
Sensibility being the characteristic of his mind, we must appeal to him through his senses. We must use the concrete; through it we must act upon his weak will and immature judgment. From his natural curiosity we must develop attention. His naturally strong perceptive powers must be made yet stronger; they must be led in proper directions and fixed upon appropriate objects. He must be led to appreciate the relation between cause and effects--to associate together related facts--and to state what he knows in a definite, clear, and forcible manner.
Object lessons, conversational lessons, lessons on animals, lessons based on pictures and other devices, have been used to meet this demand of the child's mental make up.",2
"Jenny set the table for the tea party under a big oak. There was a flat place on one of the round roots that rose out of the moss, which was the very thing for a table. So there she spread the little white and gold plates and cups and saucers, with the meat dish (every bit as large as your hand), in the middle, full of candy. The milk, of course, was put in the pot for coffee, and set on three dead leaves to boil; and Jenny allowed Donee to fill the jam dishes herself, with her own hands. Donee could hardly get her breath as she did it.
When they were all ready they sat down. The sun shone, and the wind was blowing, and the water of the mill-race flashed and gurgled as it went by, and a song-sparrow perched himself on the fence close to them and sang, and sang, just as if he knew what was going on.
""He wants to come to the party!"" said Betty, and then they all laughed. Donee laughed too.",0
"A dog of FlandersÛÓyellow of hide, large of head and limb, with wolf-like ears that stood erect, and legs bowed and feet widened in the muscular development wrought in his breed by many generations of hard service.

Patrasche had been born of parents who had labored hard all their days over the sharp-set stones of the various cities and the long, shadowless, weary roads of the two Flanders and of Brabant. He had been born to no other heritage than those of pain and of toil. He had been fed on curses and baptized with blows. Why not? It was a Christian country, and Patrasche was but a dog. Before he was fully grown he had known the bitter gall of the cart and the collar.",2
"Once at sunset an old man came through the forest where the poplar trees lived. The trees were going to sleep, and it was growing dark.
The man held something under his cloak. It was a pot of goldÛÓthe very pot of gold that lies at the foot of the rainbow. He had stolen it and was looking for some place to hide it. A poplar tree stood by the path.
""This is the very place to hide my treasure,"" the man said. ""The branches spread out straight, and the leaves are large and thick. How lucky that the trees are all asleep!""
He placed the pot of gold in the thick branches, and then ran quickly away.
The gold belonged to Iris, the beautiful maiden who had a rainbow bridge to the earth. The next morning she missed her precious pot. It always lay at the foot of the rainbow, but it was not there now.
Iris hurried away to tell her father, the great Zeus, of her loss. He said that he would find the pot of gold for her.",0
"Homo sapiens (Latin: ""wise man"") is the binomial nomenclature (also known as the scientific name) for the human species.
Homo is the human genus, which also includes Neanderthals and many other extinct species of hominid; H. sapiens is the only surviving species of the genus Homo. Modern humans are sometimes called ""anatomically modern humans"". Homo sapiens considers itself the most influential species on the planet, but many species of life, mostly plants and protists, have had a much greater effect on the outside of Earth and its air.
The recent African origin of modern humans is the mainstream model describing the origin and dispersal of anatomically modern humans. The hypothesis that humans have a single origin was published in Charles Darwin's The Descent of Man (1871). The concept is supported by a study of present-day mitochondrial DNA, and with evidence based on physical anthropology of fossil humans.",2
"There are two ways that scientists talk about amnesia. First, amnesia can happen alongside other problems. For example, there are some diseases and injuries that can cause damage to the hippocampus and cause memory loss. These include Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury. Both of these conditions can cause memory loss, but they usually also cause other problems for a person's ability to think. For example, a person with Alzheimer's disease or traumatic brain injury might have difficulty planning for the day or making good decisions. So, when people with Alzheimer's disease or traumatic brain injury have memory loss, we say that they have amnesia as one of their symptoms. People can have different degrees of amnesia as a symptom, from mild memory problems to severe memory problems. Having amnesia as part of a large set of problems is fairly common. But amnesia can also occur by itself, without other problems.",1
"Many people like to learn about their family histories: what their parents, grandparents and even great-grandparents were like and where they came from, or if they are related to an important historical person. Or, they might like to know if a physical feature or behavior they share with an aunt or cousin was passed down from a common relative. Scientists called paleoanthropologists, are interested in the family history of Homo sapiens, the species to which all people living today belong. Unlike paleontologists who study the remains of dinosaurs, paleoanthropologists scientists who study ancient humans and their relatives, study the remains of hominins, a group of primates that includes humans and all of their extinct ancestors and relatives.. Hominins are a group of primates that includes humans and all our extinct ancestors and relatives, most of whom lived in the last 6ÛÒ7 million years. Like someone trying to trace a family tree, paleoanthropologists try to figure out which of the extinct hominins might be our direct ancestors and which are just distant cousins. These scientists also try to understand what the hominins ate, where they lived, how they died, and other things about the lives of these ancient relatives.",1

"The Solar System is the Sun and all the objects in orbit around it. The Sun is orbited by planets, asteroids, comets and other things.
The Sun is a star. It contains 99.9 percent of the Solar System's mass. This means that it has strong gravity. The other objects are pulled into orbit around the Sun. The sun is mostly made out of hydrogen and helium.
There are eight planets in the Solar System. From closest to farthest from the Sun, they are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The first four planets are called terrestrial planets. They are mostly made of rock and metal, and they are mostly solid. The last four planets are called gas giants. This is because they are large planets that are mostly made of gas. Even though they are made of gas, they have much more mass than the terrestrial planets.",0
"When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.",1
"  OpenStreetMap (OSM), a collaborative, crowdsourced Web map, is a uniquesource of openly available worldwide map data, increasingly adopted in Webapplications. Vandalism detection is a critical task to support trust andmaintain OSM transparency. This task is remarkably challenging due to the largescale of the dataset, the sheer number of contributors, various vandalismforms, and the lack of annotated data. This paper presents Ovid - a novelattention-based method for vandalism detection in OSM. Ovid relies on a novelneural architecture that adopts a multi-head attention mechanism to summarizeinformation indicating vandalism from OSM changesets effectively. To facilitateautomated vandalism detection, we introduce a set of original features thatcapture changeset, user, and edit information. Furthermore, we extract adataset of real-world vandalism incidents from the OSM edit history for thefirst time and provide this dataset as open data. Our evaluation conducted onreal-world vandalism data demonstrates the effectiveness of Ovid.",2
"One day last summer, at the great Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, I overheard a conversation that interested me very much. The subject of it was a strange little animal called a ""gopher,"" which sat stuck up in a case with its comical little head perched up in the air; for it wasn't even alive, but was a poor little stuffed gopher.
In front of the case I noticed two farmers, who were talking about my little friend in a very earnest way: so I listened to their remarks.
""Yes,"" said one, ""I tell you he is a dreadful creature to dig. Why, he makes us a sight of trouble out our way! can't keep anything that he can dig for, away from him.""
""Is that so?"" said the other man.
""Yes. Why, I pay my boys five cents for every one of 'em they catch; and it's lively work getting 'em, I tell you! See his nose, now! doesn't that look sharp? I tell you, when that fellow gets hold of a job, he keeps right at it! There is no giving up in him.""",1
"Nagari was much troubled at this saying, and marveled greatly. Then one woman made bold to rise up, and saying, ""I shall return,"" she went to seek the sweet music. Now this woman never returned. After a time, another woman arose and said, ""Stay here, my friends; I shall return.""
Then she went in like manner to look for the music. And she returned not. And so with each woman, until Nagari was left sitting alone as he had been at the beginning.
Now Webubu was still playing his flute on the platform he had built in the corkwood tree, when the women came in sight. He was alarmed for the safety of his frail platform, when he saw these many people advancing, and he cried, ""Come not up into the tree. Remain below, I beseech you, O women!""
But the women were consumed with eagerness to be close to the music which had taken their hearts, and they climbed, all of them, until they were upon the platform of Webubu.",2
"Italian painters received their names in peculiar ways. This man's father was a tailor; and the artist was named after his father's profession. He was in fact ""the Tailor's Andrea,"" and his father's name was Angelo.
One story of this brilliant painter which reads from first to last like a romance has been told by the poet, Browning, who dresses up fact so as to smother it a little, but there is truth at the bottom.
Andrea married a wife whom he loved tenderly. She had a beautiful face that seemed full of spirituality and feeling, and Andrea painted it over and over again. The artist loved his work and dreamed always of the great things that he should do; but he was so much in love with his wife that he was dependent on her smile for all that he did which was well done, and her frown plunged him into despair.",1
"In 1831, there were a considerable number of paddle steamers running along some of the rivers in England, and across the Channel to the Continent. But there were no ocean steamers, properly so-called, and there were no steamers used for warlike purposes. As in the case of the wagon boilers, the boilers of the paddle steamers of 1831 were most unsuited for resisting pressure. They were mere tanks, and there was as much pressure when there was no steam in the boiler from the weight of the water on the bottom, as there was at the top of the boiler from the steam pressure when the steam was up. Under these circumstances, again, from 3å? lb. to 5 lb. was all the pressure the boilers were competent to bear, and as the engines ran at a slow speed, they developed but a small amount of horse-power in relation to their size.",2
"  The evolution of personal income distribution (PID) in four countries:Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA follows a unique trajectory. We haverevealed precise match in the shape of two age-dependent features of the PID:mean income and the portion of people with the highest incomes (2 to 5% of theworking age population). Because of the U.S. economic superiority, as expressedby real GDP per head, the curves of mean income and the portion of rich peoplecurrently observed in three chasing countries one-to-one reproduce the curvesmeasured in the USA 15 to 25 years before. This result of cross countrycomparison implies that the driving force behind the PID evolution is the samein four studied countries. Our parsimonious microeconomic model, which linksthe change in PID only with one exogenous parameter - real GDP per capita,accurately predicts all studied features for the U.S. This study proves thatour quantitative model, based on one first-order differential equation, isuniversal. For example, new observations in Canada, New Zealand, and the UKconfirm our previous finding that the age of maximum mean income is defined bythe root-square dependence on real GDP per capita.",2
"It is a market night, and the streets will be a moving mass of men and women buying at the hucksters' stalls. Everything that can be sold at a stall is there: fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, crockery, tin-ware, children's clothing, cheap toys, boots, shoes, and sun-bonnets, all in reckless confusion. The vendors cry their wares in stentorian tones, vying with one another to produce excitement and induce patronage, while gas-jets are streaming into the air from the roofs and flaring from the sides of the stalls; children crying, children dancing to the strains of an accordion, children quarrelling, children scrambling for the refuse fruit. In the midst of this spectacle, this din and uproar, the women are chaffering and bargaining quite calmly, watching the scales to see that they get their full pennyworth or sixpennyworth of this or that. To the student of faces, of manners, of voices, of gestures; to the person who sees unwritten and unwritable stories in all these groups of men, women, and children, the scene reveals many things: some comedies, many tragedies, a few plain narratives (thank God!) and now and thenÛÓonly now and thenÛÓa romance.",2
"Once upon a time, there was a family that owned a big farm. They had a lot of peanuts and corn on their farm. All the animals with four legs went to the farm to eat the crops of this family. Now the rabbit was very clever. It would spot the owners as they came to the farm. The rabbit would shout, ""Robbers! Robbers!"" as soon as it saw the farmers, and all the animals would run away. As time passed, the family realized that their crops were being eaten. They put out a large doll to frighten the animals and protect the farm. They put glue all over the doll's body. The next day, the animals went to the farm and saw the doll. They decided not to return because they thought that the doll would catch them. The doll frightened all the animals, except the rabbit. It returned the following day.",0
"Blu-ray Disc is a high-density optical disc format similar to DVD. Blu-ray is the type of disc used for PlayStation 3 games and for playing high-definition (HD) movies. In the past, there were other standards for such movies, such as the HD DVD format. Blu-ray won what is called the format war.
A dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store up to 50GB (gigabytes) of data. This is over five times the capacity of a DVD, and over 70 times more than a CD or VCD.
The disc was developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA). a group of consumer electronics, personal computer and media manufacturers. The format was developed to enable recording, rewriting and playback of high-definition video (HD), as well as storing large amounts of data.
While current optical disc technologies such as DVD, DVDå±R, DVDå±RW, and DVD-RAM rely on a red laser to read and write data, the new format uses a blue-violet laser instead. This is where the name is from.",1
"Civic technology is technology (mainly information technology) that enables engagement or participation of the public for stronger development, enhancing citizen communications, improving government infrastructure, and generally improving the public good. It encompasses civic applications, platforms supporting government bodies, institutions and other software enabling those goals.
The definition of what constitutes civic technology is contested to a certain extent, especially with regards to companies engaged in the sharing or access economy, such as Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb. For example, AirBnb's ability to provide New York residents with housing during the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy could be considered a form of civic technology. However, Nathaniel Heller, Managing Director of the Research for Development Institute's Governance Program contends that for-profit platforms definitively fall outside of the scope of civic technology: Heller has said that ""while citizen-to-citizen sharing is indeed involved, the mission of these companies is focused on maximizing profit for their investors, not any sort of experiment in building social capital.""",2
"This stove consists of two or more superposed pipes provided with radiators. A gas burner is placed at the entrance of either the upper or lower pipe, according to circumstances. The products of combustion are discharged through a pipe of small diameter, which may be readily inserted into an already existing chimney or be hidden behind the wainscoting. The heat furnished by the gas flame is so well absorbed by radiation from the radiator rings that the gases, on making their exit, have no longer a temperature of more than from 35 to 40 degrees.
The apparatus, which is simple, compact, and cheap, is surrounded on all sides with an ornamented sheet iron casing. Being entirely of cast iron, it will last for a long time. The joints, being of asbestos, are absolutely tight, so as to prevent the escape of bad odors. The water due to the condensation of the gases is led through a small pipe out of doors or into a vessel from whence it may evaporate anew, so as not to change the hygrometric state of the air.",2
"Fog is an accumulation of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended above the surface of the Earth. It forms when moist air is cooled below a specific temperature and some of the water vapor condenses (turns to tiny liquid droplets). By definition, the weather is considered foggy when we cannot see more than 1000 m ahead. In his book, Robert L. May described fog ""as thick as white fizz"" and near zero visibility (it was ""dark and drear""), which suggests that the fog could have been one of two possible types: radiation fog or ice fog. Radiation fog happens when the ground cools the air above it by contact. Ice fog occurs when warm air interacts with extremely cold air and the water vapor changes directly into a solid, forming tiny ice crystals suspended in the air.
The ability of light to shine through fog varies according to the color of light.",1
"  The interplay between process behaviour and spatial aspects of computationhas become more and more relevant in Computer Science, especially in the fieldof collective adaptive systems, but also, more generally, when dealing withsystems distributed in physical space. Traditional verification techniques arewell suited to analyse the temporal evolution of programs; properties of spaceare typically not explicitly taken into account. We propose a methodology toverify properties depending upon physical space. We define an appropriatelogic, stemming from the tradition of topological interpretations of modallogics, dating back to earlier logicians such as Tarski, where modalitiesdescribe neighbourhood. We lift the topological definitions to a more generalsetting, also encompassing discrete, graph-based structures. We further extendthe framework with a spatial until operator, and define an efficient modelchecking procedure, implemented in a proof-of-concept tool.",2
"The history of British North America in the quarter of a century that followed the War of 1812 is in the main the homely tale of pioneer life. Slowly little clearings in the vast forest were widened and won to order and abundance; slowly community was linked to community; and out of the growing intercourse there developed the complex of ways and habits and interests that make up the everyday life of a people.
All the provinces called for settlers, and they did not call in vain. For a time northern New England continued to overflow into the Eastern Townships of Lower Canada, the rolling lands south of the St. Lawrence which had been left untouched by riverbound seigneur and habitant. Into Upper Canada, as well, many individual immigrants came from the south, some of the best the Republic had to give, merchants and manufacturers with little capital but much shrewd enterprise, but also some it could best spare, fugitives from justice and keepers of the taverns that adorned every four corners. Yet slowly this inflow slackened.",2

When dinner-time came, Jamie had to be coaxed away from his sand-heap; and mamma said she believed he would sleep in it, if he were allowed to.
After dinner, as soon as he waked from his nap, he went straight to his sand again. Freddy was there before him; and soon Minnie Rich, a little girl eleven years old, came out, and played with them.
She knew how to work sand better than any of them. First she wet it. Then she made a house with holes in the sides for doors and windows, and a chip for a chimney. Then she made a smooth lawn in front of the house, and some hills and valleys in the rear, fenced in a yard, and set out some flowers.",0
"One morning Hoangti and his wife were in the beautiful palace garden. They walked up and down, up and down, talking of their people.
Suddenly the emperor said, ""Look at those worms on the mulberry trees, Si-ling. They seem to be spinning.""
Si-ling looked, and sure enough, the worms were spinning. A long thread was coming from the mouth of each, and each little worm was winding this thread around its body.
Si-ling and the emperor stood still and watched the worms. ""How wonderful!"" said Si-ling.
The next morning Hoangti and the empress walked under the trees again. They found some worms still winding thread. Others had already spun their cocoons and were fast asleep. In a few days all of the worms had spun cocoons.
""This is indeed a wonderful, wonderful thing!"" said Si-ling. ""Why, each worm has a thread on its body long enough to make a house for itself!""",0
"There are, however, three fundamental principles to be borne in mind if we would follow the explanation clearly from step to step, and these three principles must be laid down at the very outset.
1. The first principle is that the existence of the energy of electric currents, and also the energy of magnetic attractions, must be sought for not so much in the wire that carries the current, or in the bar of steel or iron that we call a magnet, as in the space that surrounds the wire or the bar.
2. The second fundamental principle is that the electric current is, in one sense, quite as much a magnetic fact as an electrical fact; and that the wire which carries a current through it has magnetic properties (so long as the current flows) and can attract bits of iron to itself as a steel magnet does.
3. The third principle to be borne in mind is that to do work of any kind, whether mechanical or electrical, requires the expenditure of energy to a certain amount.",2
"Most people know that physical activity is important for their physical health. People who are more physically active have a smaller risk of getting ill (for example, developing heart disease), they tend to live longer and they have a higher quality of life. Because of this, an average of at least 60 min of physical activity per day is recommended for children and teenagers. Unfortunately, fewer and fewer children and teens are getting the recommended amount of exerciseÛÓsedentary (seated or inactive) behavior is increasing, especially in developed countries. 
Lack of exercise is not just a cause for concern because physical exercise is good for physical health, but because there is a connection between physical activity and the human brain. You may have heard the saying ""be smart, exercise your heart""? Well, a large amount of research has been conducted that shows that physical exercise has positive effects on the brain. This research indicates that exercise can boost your brainpower under certain circumstances. More specifically, this means that physical activity can help the brain to work better and more efficiently.",0

It is impossible in a few words to give a correct account of the work of WÌ¦hler, and to show in what way his life and work have been of such great value to chemistry. Could he himself direct the preparation of this notice, the writer knows that his advice would be, ""Keep to the facts.""

"The term Great Awakening can refer to several periods of religious revival in American religious history. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these ""Great Awakenings"" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.
The Awakenings all resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of personal guilt and of their need of salvation by Christ. Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made religion intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual guilt and redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality.",1

"The Hundred Years' War was fought between France and England during the late Middle Ages. It lasted 116 years from 1337 to 1453. The war started because Charles IV of France died in 1328 without a son. Edward III of England then believed he had the right to become the new king of France through his mother.
The French did not want a foreign king, so Philip VI of France said he ought to be king because by the Salic law women could not rule or transmit the right to rule to their sons. The two countries went to war because of this disagreement.
At the beginning of the war France was the stronger of the two countries. France had about 17 million people while England had only about 4 million people. France had an alliance with Scotland against England, and England tried to ally with parts of the Low Countries. The English won a great victory at sea in the Battle of Sluys in 1340 which prevented France from invading England. After that the war was fought almost totally in France.",1
"A nomad (Greek: nomades; meaning one roaming about for pasture, pastoral tribe) is a member of a community of people who live in different locations, moving from one place to another. Among the various ways nomads relate to their environment, one can distinguish the hunter-gatherer, the pastoral nomad owning livestock, or the ""modern"" peripatetic nomad. As of 1995, there were an estimated 30ÛÒ40 million nomads in the world. Nomadic hunting and gathering, following seasonally available wild plants and game, is by far the oldest human subsistence method. Pastoralists raise herds, driving them, and/or moving with them, in patterns that normally avoid depleting pastures beyond their ability to recover. Nomadism is also a lifestyle adapted to infertile regions such as steppe, tundra, or ice and sand, where mobility is the most efficient strategy for exploiting scarce resources.",1

"The Chinese were among the first civilizations to refine oil. As early as the first century, the Chinese were refining crude oil for use as an energy source. Between 512 and 518, in the late Northern Wei Dynasty, the Chinese geographer, writer and politician Li Daoyuan introduced the process of refining oil into various lubricants in his famous work Commentary on the Water Classic. Crude oil was often distilled by Arab chemists, with clear descriptions given in Arabic handbooks such as those of Muhammad ibn Zakariya Razi (854ÛÒ925). The streets of Baghdad were paved with tar, derived from petroleum that became accessible from natural fields in the region. In the 9th century, oil fields were exploited in the area around modern Baku, Azerbaijan. These fields were described by the Arab geographer Abu al-Hasan 'Ali al-Mas'udi in the 10th century, and by Marco Polo in the 13th century, who described the output of those wells as hundreds of shiploads. Arab and Persian chemists also distilled crude oil in order to produce flammable products for military purposes. Through Islamic Spain, distillation became available in Western Europe by the 12th century.",2
"  Particle based optimization algorithms have recently been developed assampling methods that iteratively update a set of particles to approximate atarget distribution. In particular Stein variational gradient descent hasgained attention in the approximate inference literature for its flexibilityand accuracy. We empirically explore the ability of this method to sample frommulti-modal distributions and focus on two important issues: (i) the inabilityof the particles to escape from local modes and (ii) the inefficacy inreproducing the density of the different regions. We propose an annealingschedule to solve these issues and show, through various experiments, how thissimple solution leads to significant improvements in mode coverage, withoutinvalidating any theoretical properties of the original algorithm.",2

"The principal business of the people of this country was the raising of sweet marjoram. The soil and climate were admirably adapted to the culture of the herb, and fields and fields of it were to be seen in every direction. At that time, and this was a good while ago, very little sweet marjoram was raised in other parts of the world, so this country had the trade nearly all to itself.
The great holiday of the year was the day on which the harvest of this national herb began. It was called ""Sweet Marjoram Day,"" and the people, both young and old, thought more of it than of any other holiday in the year.
On that happy day everybody went out into the fields. There was never a person so old, or so young, or so busy that they could not go to help in the harvest. Even when there were sick people, which was seldom, they were carried out to the fields and staid there all day. And they generally felt much better in the evening.",1

"One day we saw a strange black cloud move in from far away. It was a swarm of locusts, headed for our village. The locusts attacked farms and ate the crops. We tried to chase the locusts away.

But they would not go. They settled on trees. Branches broke because of the weight of all the locusts. Then we remembered that roasted locusts are good to eat! Everyone started to collect the locusts in sacks and nets. Children brought gourds and filled them with locusts. We roasted locusts and fried them. We even dried locusts for the cold season. But still, there were so many locusts. Then, the next morning, the locusts flew away. The cloud left our village. When the farmers saw their farms, they moaned loudly: ""Our farms are destroyed!""

Inside the cells, there are more fatty membrane compartments called ""organelles"" that all have their own important jobs. One of the most important organelles is the nucleus. This is where the genetic information in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is found. The nucleus controls which different proteins are expressed in each different type of cell.

"  The hydrogen peroxide is present in the living cell at small concentrationsthat increase under the action of the heavy ion beams in the process ofanticancer therapy.

In the present work thecompetitive binding of the hydrogen peroxide and water molecules with the DNAdouble helix backbone has been studied using the molecular dynamics method. Thesimulations have been carried out for the DNA double helix in a water solutionwith hydrogen peroxide molecules and Na$^{+}$ counterions. The obtained radialdistribution functions of counterions, H$_2$O$_2$ and H$_2$O molecules withrespect to the oxygen atoms of DNA phosphate groups have been used for theanalysis of the formation of different complexes.

"Teenagers have very important socio-emotional developmental goals ÛÓlike discovering who they are and developing relationships with othersÛÓwhich might be influenced by social media. Teenagers are prone to pay a lot of attention to the number of likes or follows on social media because it feels especially important to be liked by peers and to feel popular and admired during this time. This need to get extrinsic rewards, specifically positive feedback from friends, might be one of the reasons why the majority of adolescents use social media constantly. Social media can be a great tool to connect with friends when used in a positive way (like learning more about what a friend likes or giving them encouragement). Another key positive aspect of social media is that it creates opportunities to develop many identities: who you are as a student, friend, sibling, or fan of your favorite band. This exploration will help you understand who you are, what and who you like.",0

In the case of semigroups, we give a simple necessary andsufficient condition for a semigroup to be absorbed by its subsemigroup. Wethen proceed to n-ary semigroups, where we conjecture an analogue of thisnecessary and sufficient condition, and prove that the conjectured condition isindeed necessary and sufficient for B to absorb A (where A is an n-arysemigroup and B is its n-ary subsemigroup) in the following three cases: when Ais commutative, when |A-B|=1 and when A is an idempotent ternary semigroup.",2

"  We propose a new algorithm to estimate the structural parameters in dynamicdiscrete choice models. The algorithm is based on the conditional choiceprobability approach, but uses the idea of Temporal-Difference learning fromthe Reinforcement Learning literature to estimate the different terms in thevalue functions. In estimating these terms with functional approximations usingbasis functions, our approach has the advantage of naturally allowing forcontinuous state spaces. Furthermore, it does not require specification oftransition probabilities, and even estimation of choice probabilities can beavoided using a recursive procedure. Computationally, our algorithm onlyrequires solving a low dimensional linear equation. We find that it issubstantially faster than existing approaches when the finite dependenceproperty does not hold, and comparable in speed to approaches that exploit thisproperty. For the estimation of dynamic games, our procedure does not requireintegrating over the actions of other players, which further heightens thecomputational advantage. We show that our estimator is consistent, andefficient under discrete state spaces. In settings with continuous states, wepropose easy to implement locally robust corrections in order to achieveparametric rates of convergence. Preliminary Monte Carlo simulations confirmthe workings of our algorithm.",2

The child burst into a flood of tears, and sobbing out, ""I'd rather go stand in the corner,"" went there instantly, and turned her dear little face to the wall.
In a few minutes the master called her, and, as she came running to him, he said: ""Will you promise me, Katie, never again to say what is not true?""
""Oh, yes, I will tryÛÓI will try never, never to do it again,"" was the contrite answer.",1
"Mr. D. had promised to give his wife a beautiful rattan rocking-chair as a Christmas present. It was his employment to sell these articles. In due time, Mrs. D. called at his place of business, and selected a chair; but, as she sat enjoying it for a few minutes, a new idea came into her mind, and she told her husband that she would gladly do without her present if he would give Jennie and Alice (their two little daughters) each a chair. Her husband agreed to this; and on Christmas Eve he took home with him two elegant little rocking-chairs. Leaving them in his garden, he went into tea, and, after taking his seat at the table, said to his children, ""I have a story to tell you, and it is a true story. Would you like to hear it?""",0
"My friend John lives in Colorado, not far from Denver; and he writes me, that he and his sister, not long ago, walked out to see some prairie dogs.
The prairie dog is about the size of a full grown squirrel, and of a like color. It makes a hole for itself in the ground. This hole is in the shape of a tunnel, and as large round as a man's hat.
Now, this little dog is so gentle, that he lets the owl and the rattlesnake come and live with him, if they like. All three are often found dwelling together. For my part, I should not much like such neighbors.
The prairie dogs live on the roots of grass. Scattered all around the entrance to their homes, you may see remnants of the dry roots which they have got for food. They are quick in their movements, and quite playful.",0
"Aladdin's Mother burst out laughing at the idea of her son wishing to be the son-in-law of the Sultan, and told him to put such thoughts out of his head at once. But Aladdin was not to be laughed out of his fancy. He knew by this time that the fruits which he had gathered from the magic garden were jewels of great value, and he insisted upon his Mother taking them to the Sultan for a present, and asking the hand of the Princess in marriage for her son.
The poor woman was terribly frightened, fearing lest the Sultan should punish her for her impudence; but Aladdin would hear of no excuses, and at last she set forth in fear and trembling, bearing the jewels on a china dish covered with a napkin.
The Sultan smiled at the idea of the son of a poor old woman asking for the hand of his daughter.
When she came before the Sultan, she told him, with many apologies and pleas for forgiveness, of her son's mad love for the Princess Badroulboudour.",0
"It is marvelous how much one can see out of the corner of the eye, while seeming to view mere scenery.
The driver looked down, as he drove safely off the bridge, and shook his head at the swirl of water that rushed and eddied, dark and muddy, close up under the rotten planking; then he cracked his whip, and the horses sturdily attacked the little hill.
Thick, overhanging trees on either side now dimmed the light again, and the two plump matrons once more glared past the opposite shoulders, profoundly unaware of each other. The husbands took on the politely surly look required of them. The blonde son's eyes still sought the brunette daughter, but it was furtively done and quite unsuccessfully, for the daughter was now doing a little glaring on her own account. The blonde matron had just swept her eyes across the daughter's skirt, estimating the fit and material of it with contempt so artistically veiled that it could almost be understood in the dark.",1
"Bessie went into the parlor one day, and noticed that the clock did not tick. ""I must wind it up,"" thought she. ""It must be very easy, for you only have to turn the key round and round.""
So Bessie began to turn the key. At first it would not move; but then she tried it the other way, and it went round and round quite easily. She was determined to do it thoroughly while she was about it: so she went on winding and winding, and was charmed to hear it begin to tick.
But all at once it made a noise,ÛÓburr-r-r-r,ÛÓand then it stopped ticking.
The hands, too, that had been going so fast, stood still. What could be the reason of it? Had it really stopped? Bessie put her ear quite near, and listened. Yes, there was not a sound.",0
"When astronauts go on spacewalks, they wear spacesuits to keep themselves safe. Inside spacesuits, astronauts have the oxygen they need to breathe. They have the water they need to drink.
Astronauts put on their spacesuits several hours before a spacewalk. The suits are pressurized. This means that the suits are filled with oxygen.
Once in their suits, astronauts breathe pure oxygen for a few hours. Breathing only oxygen gets rid of all the nitrogen in an astronaut's body. If they didn't get rid of the nitrogen, the astronauts might get gas bubbles in their body when they walked in space. These gas bubbles can cause astronauts to feel pain in their shoulders, elbows, wrists and knees. This pain is called getting ""the bends"" because it affects the places where the body bends, Scuba divers can also get ""the bends.""
Astronauts are now ready to get out of their spacecraft. They leave the spacecraft through a special door called an airlock. The airlock has two doors.",0
"Mrs. S. had a new cook; and one day she set a pan of custard on the back porch to cool. When she went out to get it, an hour or two after, she found nothing but the empty pan. Molly ran to Mrs. S. in great distress, and told her of the loss of the custard. ""Ah!"" said Mrs. S., ""then Daisy has eaten it."" And, sure enough, Daisy was the thief.
Another time the naughty colt put her head in the kitchen-window, and ate up some apple pies that were on the table. All this was very bad indeed, but Daisy was always forgiven because she was so lovely and gentle. She would follow any of the family about the grounds, and rub her head against them to show how much she loved them.
One day a man came to Mr. S.'s house to make a visit. He was not in the habit of visiting the family, and so had not made Daisy's acquaintance.",0
"Some of the stories told of his childish brightness are hard to believe. They relate, for instance, that before he was two years old he could talk almost as plainly and clearly as a grown person; that he could repeat many passages of ""Pilgrim's Progress,"" from having heard them, before he could read; and that at five years old he could read very rapidly, and remembered almost everything he read.
His father, the wood-carver, had died while Humphry was still very young, and had left his family poor. But by good-fortune a kind neighbor and friend, a Mr. Tonkine, took care of the widow and her children, and obtained a place for Humphry as an apprentice with an apothecary of the town. Humphry proved, indeed, a rather troublesome inmate of the apothecary's house. He set up a chemical laboratory in his little room upstairs, and there devoted himself to all sorts of experiments. Every now and then an explosion would be heard, which made the members of the apothecary's household quake with terror.",1
"You have already met Theodore, or Teddy or Ted Martin, and his sister Janet, or Jan. With their mother, they were spending the long summer vacation on Cherry Farm, the country home of Grandpa Martin outside the town of Elmburg, near Clover Lake. Mr. Richard Martin, or Dick, as Grandpa Martin called him, owned a store in Cresco, where he lived with his family. Besides Ted and Jan there was Baby William, aged about three years. He was called Trouble, for the reason I have told you, though Mother Martin called him ""Dear Trouble"" to make up for the fun Ted and Jan sometimes poked at him.
Then there was Nora Jones, the maid who helped Mrs. Martin with the cooking and housework. And I must not forget Skyrocket, a dog, nor Turnover, a cat. These did not help with the houseworkÛÓthough I suppose you might say they did, too, in a way, for they ate the scraps from the table and this helped to save work.",1
"Sinyaire village was surrounded by hills. Many snakes lived in the forest on those hills. The biggest snake was called Unyalego by the villagers. Unyalego scared many people. It swallowed whole goats and sheep. 
One day, three sisters, Apiyo, Ajoh and Atieno went to the forest to fetch firewood. The girls' grandmother warned, ""Beware of Unyalego the big snake. Do not take anything from the forest except the wood."" Only Ajoh did not pay attention to her grandmother. 
The girls packed milk, bananas, sweet potatoes and water. They took ropes for tying firewood and a sharp machete for chopping the wood. Then they left for the forest. 
On the way, the sisters chatted and laughed. Suddenly, Apiyo, the eldest of them, said, ""Be quiet. We are coming to where Unyalego the snake lives."" 
Atieno called to the others, ""Look, here are Unyalego's golden teeth. Let us take them."" Apiyo reminded them, ""Don't forget grandmother's warning. We must not take anything from the forest except firewood."" 
Ajoh said, ""I don't trust grandmother. She said that to stop us having what we want. I want the golden teeth."" Her sisters were worried, but Ajoh did not care.",1
"Within the last ten months, contracts for war supplies estimated to exceed $1,000,000,000 have been placed in the United States.
When war was declared last August, this country was suffering from acute industrial depression; many factories shut down, others operating on short time, and labor without employment. After the paralyzing effect of the news that war was declared had worn away, businessmen here realized the great opportunity about to be afforded them of furnishing war supplies which must soon be in demand. Their expectations were soon fulfilled, as almost immediately most of the Governments sent commissions to the United States. Some had orders to buy, while others were authorized to get prices and submit samples.
It was not long until mills and factories were being operated to capacity, turning out boots and shoes, blankets, sweaters, socks, underwear, &c. The manufacturers of these articles were merely required to secure additional help in order to increase their plants' production.",1
"""There is no telling how dangerous those explosions may become,"" said Captain Dale, ""and Colonel Colby thinks it is best that you remain here where it is comparatively safe. Even as it is, we may have some big shells coming this way.""
The Hasley Shell Loading Company had been located on the opposite shore of Clearwater Lake for a number of years previous to the opening of the war in Europe. But at that time it had been only a small concern, employing but a handful of men. A year after the opening of hostilities, however, the plant had been enlarged, and now, since the entrance of the United States into the war, the force of workmen had been again doubled and many additional buildings had been erected, some along the lake front and others in the hills further back. A spur of the railroad had also been built to the plant, and on this were numerous cars, all painted to show the dangerous nature of the freight they were destined to carry.",1
"This great king, in the first year of his reign, fought nine battles with the Danes. He made some treaties with them too, by which the false Danes swore that they would quit the country. They pretended to consider that they had taken a very solemn oath in swearing this upon the holy bracelets that they wore, and which were always buried with them when they died; but they cared little for it, for they thought nothing of breaking oaths, and treaties too, as soon as it suited their purpose, and coming back again to fight, plunder, and burn, as usual. One fatal winter, in the fourth year of King Alfred's reign, they spread themselves in great numbers over the whole of England; and so dispersed and routed the king's soldiers that the king was left alone, and was obliged to disguise himself as a common peasant, and to take refuge in the cottage of one of his cowherds who did not know his face.",1
"From a rocky hill above me the baboons were barking. Just below us was a fair stream with a rich grove of native trees on the further bank. Some native gardens showed on the slope above. The white path wound through them, then away among boulders, some of them very big ones. While I watched the stream I saw a white body of mist mounting up. Just at that moment the sun showed. As I looked on the sacred sight I saw somebody coming down the path. It was the man whose mission station I had been looking for. He was coming through the long grass in a hurry. Soon he splashed through the drift. After that he caught sight of me, and rushed up to our camp, glowing. It was Leonard Reeve. He looked much the same as he did that day in London three years beforeÛÓdark, pale, slight, earnest. I had been to his sendoff and gone down to Victoria Docks with him. I had written to tell him; I was most likely coming his way after Easter. He seemed ever so glad to see me.",1
"One night they saw one star that shone brighter than all others. Its location was far away in the south, near a mountain peak. For many nights it was seen, till at length it was doubted by many that the star was as far distant in the southern skies as it seemed to be. This doubt led to an examination, which proved the star to be only a short distance away, and near the tops of some trees. A number of warriors were deputed to go and see what it was. They went, and on their return said it appeared strange, and somewhat like a bird. A committee of the wise men were called to inquire into, and if possible to ascertain the meaning of, the strange phenomenon. They feared that it might be the omen of some disaster. Some thought it a precursor of good, others of evil; and some supposed it to be the star spoken of by their forefathers as the forerunner of a dreadful war.",1
"  Randomized algorithms are used in many state-of-the-art solvers forconstraint satisfaction problems (CSP) and Boolean satisfiability (SAT)problems. For many of these problems, there is no single solver which willdominate others. Having access to the underlying runtime distributions (RTD) ofthese solvers can allow for better use of algorithm selection, algorithmportfolios, and restart strategies. Previous state-of-the-art methods directlytry to predict a fixed parametric distribution that the input instance follows.In this paper, we extend RTD prediction models into the Bayesian setting forthe first time. This new model achieves robust predictive performance in thelow observation setting, as well as handling censored observations. Thistechnique also allows for richer representations which cannot be achieved bythe classical models which restrict their output representations. Our modeloutperforms the previous state-of-the-art model in settings in which data isscarce, and can make use of censored data such as lower bound time estimates,where that type of data would otherwise be discarded. It can also quantify itsuncertainty in its predictions, allowing for algorithm portfolio models to makebetter informed decisions about which algorithm to run on a particularinstance.",2
"All at once it came into Alan's head that Uncle Paul had once been attacked by a wolf, and that they ought to have an adventure of the same kind: he therefore asked Owen if he would consent to be eaten up by a wolf. Owen said he did not like it: he thought Alan ought to be eaten, for he was the biggest. Alan said that would never do; for then there would be nobody to care for him and Amy.
But, besides this difficulty, there was another: they had no wolf; and, where to get one, they did not know. At last it was settled. Owen was to be the wolf, and to spring on Amy; but before he had eaten her up, or even so much as snapped off her little finger, Alan was to rush upon him with his stick, and drive him back into the woods.
Amy was now left alone, that Owen might get behind one bush, and Alan behind another. No sooner was this done, than, with her basket on her arm, she went on her journey.",1
"A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothingÛÓincluding particles and electromagnetic radiation such as lightÛÓcan escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although crossing the event horizon has enormous effect on the fate of the object crossing it, it appears to have no locally detectable features. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.",1

"And what have I invested in interpreting disfocus for chaos? This threat: the only lesson is to wait. I crouch in the smoggy terminus. The streets lose edges, the rims of thought flake. What have I set myself to fix in this dirty notebook that is not mine? Does the revelation that, though it cannot be done with words, it might be accomplished in some lingual gap, give me the right, in injury, walking with a woman and her dog in pain? Rather the long doubts: that this labor tears up the mind's moorings; that, though life may be important in the scheme, awareness is an imperfect tool with which to face it. To reflect is to fight away the sheets of silver, the carbonated distractions, the feeling that, somehow, a thumb is pressed on the right eye. This exhaustion melts what binds, releases what flows.",2

It was impossible for me to climb because every step was six feet high. I was trying to find a gap in the hedge when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field walking towards the fence.

"It is not easy to find out where oil is, deep down below the earth. Scientists use special techniques and machines to find this out. Then through pipes and machines petroleum is pumped up. This oil is a smelly, thick, dark coloured liquid. It contains any things mixed in it. To clean and separate these, it is sent to a refinery. Have you heard of a refinery? It is from this petroleum or oil that we get kerosene, diesel, petrol, engine oil and fuel for aircrafts. Do you know that L.P.G.
